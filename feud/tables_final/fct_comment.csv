1,2,1,jpgenius ,I had a dream about the Cloweses’ 🚗 win.
2,2,2,jpgenius ,BTW the Simmons family were here 2 yrs. prior.
3,4,1,JP Genius ,"Did Mark REALLY just say…? Yeah, I think I’m gonna boycott the Feud!"
4,5,1,jpgenius ,Always nice to see a family come back and win the 🚗. Go Simmons family!
5,6,1,jpgenius ,Stowers family KILLED IT! Especially Checo! This family ROCKS!
6,6,2,jpgenius ,"Bobby, I’m pretty sure you wanted the Stowers family to win the car, huh?"
7,9,1,JP Genius ,Man! No car for the Stowerses? And they were so good!
8,9,2,jpgenius ,"Well, it wouldn’t do us any justice not to bring them back, and we did so on 2/21/2017. And of course, they got themselves a 🚗."
9,9,3,Matthew Yothers ,"I agree, and also I think the Dickens family competed on the Feud two years ago. Did anyone else realize that?"
10,9,4,jpgenius ,Yes.
11,9,5,jpgenius ,It took a while to figure that one out.
12,10,1,JP Genius ,"Bobby, guess what? Zoey Davis on the Feud is Zoey Davis from Wheel of Fortune (6/13/12)!"
13,10,2,jpgenius ,These five sisters… 😂😂😂
14,11,1,Matthew Yothers ,Karen should have said golf for that last question.
15,11,2,FEWDLUVR3 ,Didn’t you mean plane for #1?
16,11,3,Matthew Yothers ,"No, train really was #1 for that question, and Karen actually said a bus for that one."
17,13,1,JP Genius ,A $50K Fast Money win. Don’t think that’s happened before.
18,13,2,jpgenius ,"If the Davises won this FM, boy…"
19,13,3,Matthew Yothers ,"$90,970 would’ve been their total, and they would’ve played for the Ford Edge the next game."
20,13,4,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, for the last question, “Something specific people put in their mouths when they’re sick,” I actually found out that thermometer was the #1 answer."
21,13,5,Matthew Yothers ,"And I believe Jacob actually said breath mint for that last question, which probably would’ve been a zero anyway."
22,14,1,JP Genius ,Current girlfriend’s just like the ex? DANG.
23,16,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Oh, man, 2 points short of 20 grand. Sorry, Albertsens."
24,21,1,agusgokil1681 ,"fyi, youngs family win $20k courtesy on youtube after winning 223points in fast money."

26,22,2,jpgenius ,What happened to the Woods family? The next day they were completely replaced.
27,22,3,jpgenius ,"What the- why would you give anyone you’re flirting with THAT, let alone your employee? Gross! 😳"
28,23,1,jpgenius ,"Jumping the Broom was a WAY better answer than Jumping Frog, IMO. I would never have guessed the latter."

33,27,2,Mitchell Hodack ,What is California?
34,27,3,jpgenius ,Sell your soul?! What?!?! 😳😳😳🙄🙄🙄😳😳😳
35,28,1,bencalebrod ,If only Shirley said garlic in the first game. I’d pay to see what Steve Harvey would do to the second person if Fast Money was already won by the first person.
36,28,2,jpgenius ,I can’t wait for that day to happen.
37,29,1,jpgenius ,Did you know that Carmen Davis was on Wheel back on Christmas Week 2010?
38,30,1,jpgenius ,OH brother. The Lacys have returned. 😁
39,31,1,jpgenius ,"Ah, the start of the Waltons’ adventure."
40,33,1,jpgenius ,"Sorry Rubadues, but I don’t think babysitters work EVERY night, only on weekends. Still, $22,585 isn’t too bad for a 4-day total."
41,34,1,bencalebrod ,"The second game’s fast wins the award for the most intense fast money of all time. I was a bit disappointed by the video, though, as I thought for sure this was going to be the first time that the first player won fast money for the whole family."
42,34,2,jpgenius ,"CLOSE Fast Money in the second game, but I’m glad Rob Jr. just barely got 201 pts. The first game – OH MY GOSH!!! Did they really use that F-bomb and add a Y?!?! This ain’t FAMILY Feud anymore, it’s PROFANITY Feud! SMH…"
43,35,1,jpgenius ,"Line dance? Really? Ride a bull was a GREAT answer, too bad it didn’t earn the Waltons a brand-new car. They’re my new favorite family on the Feud."
44,35,2,jpgenius ,Replace “car” with 🚗.
45,35,3,jpgenius ,"And a woman wants her man to be huge, Amanda? OK now… 😂😂😂 The Waltons are full of funny answers."
46,37,1,jpgenius ,"The best way to pass a – wow, Kenny. WOW. 😳"
47,38,1,Matthew Yothers ,I heard “Name something listed on a wedding invitation.”
48,40,1,jpgenius ,Sorry to see the Raglands lose like that. 😦
49,40,2,jpgenius ,"Worse, the DeVere family lost the car in Sudden Death exactly 6 years prior. Sad. 😥"
50,40,3,Matthew Yothers ,"I’m just curious, how much money did the DeVere family leave with overall?"
51,40,4,jpgenius ,"$20,930 (they won $19,000 in the Bullseye in game 4)."
52,41,1,jpgenius ,I don’t think Mexico’s a state…
53,41,2,jpgenius ,WOW… 😳😳😳

55,43,2,ant0824 ,"I’ll tell you, we got a couple of Dumb Families ever"
56,43,3,jpgenius ,"Well, I feel REAL bad for the Gallaghers. They came back from 3 1/2 years prior to lose the car? Sucks."
57,43,4,Matthew Yothers ,"Yeah, but overall, they didn’t do too bad though, they’re still finished their run with $21,570."
58,44,1,jpgenius ,"For the wedding/funeral question, Rhyann actually said sadness. Sadness at a wedding?"
59,44,2,Matthew Yothers ,This is actually the Thurman family’s 2nd game.
60,44,3,Matthew Yothers ,"And for the binge question, Steve said drinking and eating tied for #1."
61,45,1,DAFEWD00 ,"Welcome back, Eggeruds."
62,46,1,Dalton Higbee ,"Don’t worry, guys! The Full J-Archive Games From March 31, April 1 & 6, 2016 will be up soon."
63,47,1,jpgenius ,FINALLY – a car win! WTG Eggeruds!
64,47,2,jpgenius ,Looks like Lauren will have an invention team after her “bad husband” answer in Fast Money.
65,48,1,jpgenius ,WHOA. The first ever Sudden Death with TWO wrong answers?!
66,48,2,jpgenius ,"Also, why are harem and h- answers? This is DEGRADING! Especially harem! 😡"
67,50,1,jpgenius ,"I dunno how James Brown, Whitney Houston, and Bob Marley did NOT make the board."
68,52,1,jpgenius ,ANOTHER car win? Go Boudreauxs! They made my area proud!
69,53,1,jpgenius ,The Harts appeared on the Feud back in 1977 AND 2001. Credit to YouTube.
70,54,1,Dalton Higbee ,I really hope Buzzy wins more than ten games.
71,54,2,jpgenius ,What happened to the Slagles?!?!
72,55,1,jpgenius ,"CNN, really? That’s not a MAGAZINE!"
73,55,2,jpgenius ,There was another game that aired. Between the Harts and the Slagle family from Austin. The Slagles won the game and $20K.
74,58,1,DAFEWD00 ,Pie in the HORSE?!! 🤣 🤣 🤣
75,60,1,ant0824 ,"Celebrities are doing Great at fast Money, In fact we have not got a Loss at Fast Money. 10 for 10 in Fast Money especially from The Band Perry Perfect first half getting 200 before the second half."
76,62,1,jpgenius ,No surprise Jaleel White nailed that FM. Two thumbs up!
77,62,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Amazing! She duplicated the answer for every single question, because Jaleel had all number ones."
78,62,3,jpgenius ,That’s a first.
79,68,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Wow, in the Thornton family, Olden looks almost exactly like Steve."
80,69,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Wow, bad 2nd attempt by the Thorntons, they got a record breaking 6 zeros in this Fast Money, but hey, they still get to come back with $20,475 in their pocket."
81,74,1,Rohan Johnson ,"First off, I am very sad to see the Holmeses go, but MAN! the Hubers were so close to get a $20k! 😢"
82,75,1,jpgenius ,"Can’t the Feud just say “make love” rather than “pet the peacock” or “get kinky with dinky”?! My goodness, this show has gotten so foul… 🙄😳"
83,76,1,jpgenius ,How did take the kids NOT make the board? Ex-wives (and husbands) do it all the time!
84,78,1,Rohan Johnson ,"Darn! I just wanted the Porter family to play for a new car, but it didn’t work because the Burneskes won the game!"
85,79,1,jpgenius ,The Childs gals are KILLIN’ IT! One more win and they’ll do what the Gray gals did 5.5 years ago – an all-female team winning the car!
86,79,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Congrats on finally winning $20,000, Childs family!"
87,80,1,jpgenius ,WHERE are the Childs gals?!?! I wanna see whether they won that car!
88,80,2,jpgenius ,Her THREE teeth?!?!
89,83,1,jpgenius ,"Aw, no doubleheader. 🙁 But we’ve had a lot of 3-day champs so far this season: the Joneses, the Porters, and now the Hutchisons."
90,84,1,jpgenius ,"Doggone it. We wait for a car game and now this? RATS. Well, it’s no big deal – at least the Childs gals won over $22,000. There’s always next time…"
91,85,1,"Nigerian Family, the Obus, Surprise Host Steve Harvey on Family Feud - NigerianMuse | NigerianMuse ","[…] put on a show, before the main show, which appears to have aired on October 11, 2016 (recap).

93,85,3,jpgenius ,How did no one get The Walking Dead?
94,85,4,jpgenius ,GO KAI!!!
95,86,1,Dalton Higbee ,Jeopardy! recap should be coming in a few minutes.
96,87,1,jpgenius ,Add the Trimbles to the list of 3-day champs in season 34. Seems like we won’t be getting that many 🚗 wins this season.
97,87,2,jpgenius ,"Excuse me, season 17. I was thinking about Wheel of Fortune!!! 😂😂😂"
98,87,3,jpgenius ,"Kai and Theatrice actually appeared on an O’Hurley episode, as part of the Dotson family. How did they do? Check it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I72zs0EQzc."
99,89,1,jpgenius ,Cinnamon ring?! 😳😳😳
100,92,1,jpgenius ,Come on Roberts fam…give us a 🚗 win tonight…
101,93,1,jpgenius ,"MAN! I didn’t think the Roberts family would win the car tonight, the Washington family were just too good. 😥😥😥 We’ll get em next time."
102,93,2,jpgenius ,The Almost Christmas special though…TOO 😂😂😂!!! Glad to see a win.
103,94,1,jpgenius ,"POTENTIAL SPOILER: The Abraham family won the nightcap and $20,000."
104,94,2,DAFEWD00 ,"Wow, was this funny! Blow out a fire with your lips? Pick up kids from school naked?"
105,94,3,DAFEWD00 ,Dang!
106,95,1,jpgenius ,Haven’t seen a family from the Aloha State win the Feud before.
107,96,1,jpgenius ,I think we knew Eric would say THAT answer (pass…). You should’ve seen Amber’s grin.
108,98,1,jpgenius ,"One more win Schaefers, one more win…and the 🚗 is yours!"
109,98,2,Nick Brundidge ,What does a horse have to do with being a thing of beauty?
110,98,3,Rohan Johnson ,This is extremely painful to watch 😢.
111,99,1,jpgenius ,WOO HOO!!! First car win of the season! Go Schaefers!!!
112,99,2,Rohan Johnson ,"Yup, and I’m glad to see the Turners win $20K. 😁😁😁"
113,100,1,jpgenius ,The Turners are KILLIN’ IT! I wouldn’t be surprised if they won Fast Money tomorrow.
114,101,1,jpgenius ,"One more Turners, one more…and the 🚗 is yours!"
115,102,1,jpgenius ,"GO TURNERS!!! I KNEW they’d win the 🚗! And like the Schaefers, it took going from zero to Sudden Death to do it!"
116,102,2,Veronique ,"Most people in my area don’t know that fast hair growth shampoos (of course with no sulfates, no parabens and no DEA) are even a thing. We all are now able to experience longer hair and possess more options. Definitely worth exploring."
117,104,1,jpgenius ,“You’re dumb/so’s your h-”?! 😳🤦🏾‍♂️😡
118,105,1,jpgenius ,"One more win, Janes family! One more! And you win the 🚗."
119,106,1,jpgenius ,"Great job winning the 🚗 AND another $20,000, Janes family!"
120,107,1,jpgenius ,GO MORROWS!!!
121,108,1,jpgenius ,Nana? And “trust in your truth”? These answers got me confused! 😳😳😳
122,110,1,Matthew Yothers ,"In the first game, they actually kept Jenna in the first position in Fast Money."
123,111,1,Rohan Johnson ,"Well, I’m sad to see the Federgreens go, but $21,580 is nothing to sneeze at."
124,112,1,jpgenius ,"Buh bye Blacks. Still, $40,705 isn’t bad for 3 days."
125,114,1,jpgenius ,The first question of the Cosios’ game is even more interesting given there’s two exes in that family.
126,116,1,jpgenius ,A free pass to do HUH?
127,116,2,jpgenius ,How did Florida get 0? Go to Miami Beach and you’ll see what I’m talking about.
128,117,1,jpgenius ,"Can’t wait to see the Cosios go for the ride on Monday. Porters, PLEASE win tomorrow so we can have a doubleheader. And stop going to Sudden Death!"
129,118,1,jpgenius ,Well this is intense – the Porters AND Cosios are going for the 🚗 on Monday. Best of luck to them!
130,118,2,jpgenius ,"Also, Miss Universe bloopers?! 😂😂😂"
131,119,1,ant0824 ,Both fast money rounds stunk badly.
132,119,2,jpgenius ,Mixed emotions for this doubleheader.
133,119,3,ant0824 ,"That got me a Rating of a 1 from Game 1 Worst ever fast Money score ever.
Rating of an 8 from Game 2 with the Cosios winning a Car but not the Fast Money."
134,119,4,jpgenius ,WHOA there – a WET dog?! Isn’t that a derogatory term? Shame on those writers! 😡😡😡
135,119,5,Rohan Johnson ,"Aw, man! The Porter family did not win the car."
136,119,6,Rohan Johnson ,Drats! I just wanted the Porter family to win that car!
137,121,1,jpgenius ,Finally! The Stapletons win the big bucks!
138,122,1,jpgenius ,"I really enjoyed the Washingtons, but…I think it’s time for another fun family to dominate."
139,122,2,jpgenius ,Scratch car.
140,123,1,jpgenius ,YES! The Stapletons have WON THE 🚗!
141,123,2,jpgenius ,"Also, it’s “well”, not “whale”."
142,123,3,Matthew Yothers ,"Amazing comeback from the Stapletons to win $22,920 and a car!"
143,123,4,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, for the question something that eats anything, I heard Steve say the #1 answer was “goat”, not “gopher”."
144,124,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Michael and Patrick got to keep their outfits for the show! I’m so glad the Broz family won the $20,000."
145,124,2,jpgenius ,Glad the Smahas got another chance and made the most of it.
146,125,1,jpgenius ,"First the Smahas, now the Fords. What are the odds of 2 families given a 2nd chance being on the same episode?"
147,126,1,jpgenius ,"First, the Smahas, then the Fords, now the Baileys. What’s with all these designated champs coming back?"
148,127,1,jpgenius ,Into HUH or WHAT?!?! 😳😳😳
149,129,1,jpgenius ,OH MY…
150,129,2,jpgenius ,And Kim’s last answer was also hilarious.
151,129,3,Matthew Yothers ,"For the second group game, Nick from the Cannon family is not the famous one."
152,130,1,jpgenius ,"I LOVED tonight’s episodes, especially Ms. Carol!"
153,131,1,jpgenius ,WOW – didn’t expect Asha’s answer in Sudden Death. 😳😳😳
154,132,1,jpgenius ,Very unusual for 2 families to miss Fast Money by 8 points on the same episode.
155,133,1,jpgenius ,GO CANNONS!!! Driving home to San Fran in a brand-new 🚗!
156,134,1,Tom Hanson ,"Regarding #1 Question.  The judges messed up on the Family Feud show that aired 2-13-17.  The contestant from the family on the left answered “floaties”, and got a third X.  The opposite family answered correctly, and when the board was revealed, the answer Raft/Float was on the board.  How did they not interpret “Floaties” to be a correct answer by the family on the left?  That family was denied the game!  How do the producers make this up to the family that was short-changed?"
157,134,2,Your Mom ,“Floaties” are the things children wear on their arms to stay afloat; it is not the same as a raft/float.  The producers properly interpreted what was said and do not owe the family anything.
158,134,3,jpgenius ,He was tired of eating Big Macs. 😂😂😂
159,138,1,jpgenius ,"Poor Susinis. As soon as I saw the Shaffers with their pom-poms, I figured they would win instead. Rats. But still, $22,360 isn’t bad for 4 days."
160,138,2,Rohan Johnson ,"Yeah, and I’m even bummed to see the Shaffers miss by 11 points in Fast Money. 😢"
161,140,1,Charles Shen ,Is the winning team the 5 time Champion one?
162,140,2,jpgenius ,Yep. The Stowers family.
163,140,3,jpgenius ,"WOW – the Stones AND Stowerses made the most of their second chances, ESPECIALLY the Stowerses! That’s the first time in Feud history that a 6th appearance results in a 🚗 win! WTG Stowers family!"
164,140,4,Matthew Yothers ,"Yes, and the Stowers family was one of the CRAZIEST families that Steve has ever met, especially when they left with the car and $42,125 in the trunk. Steve certainly had a blast with them, too."
165,140,5,futuresamthegameshow ,Rating: 9
166,144,1,jpgenius ,Looks like you’re pulling up all the old episodes. How did you get the 11/22/12 episode?
167,144,2,jpgenius ,"Excuse me, you can’t say THAT (the answer in question 2) on TV."
168,145,1,jpgenius ,"The answer that probably brought the Finchs back the next season was “wife has a baby”, which is basically the same as “hospital”."
169,146,1,jpgenius ,I thought the biggest state’s AK.
170,146,2,FEWDLUVR33 ,"I know right? Also, when they asked how many states start with new, they said the #1 answer is 3, but it’s 4! These kind’s of questions can’t be in FM, because they only have 1 right answer!"
171,147,1,jpgenius ,I think the unrevealed #1 answer (for Hawaii) was surf.
172,147,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Surf WAS the #1 answer for that one, and Jim really struggled in that Fast Money, but still at least it wasn’t 5 zeros."
173,149,1,jpgenius ,"Mike, you can’t say that on TV."
174,151,1,jpgenius ,Poor Mastrinos.
175,151,2,jpgenius ,"By the way, the 2/22/2013 nightcap was actually the last nightcap of the season."
176,151,3,Rohan Johnson ,Man! The Mastrinos did not win the 🚗 so I had to make a Berens Amusement Park on RCT3 for the them!
177,153,1,jpgenius ,Go Flammias! 🚗
178,153,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Wow, just 2 games aired already in Group 1, and the Flammia family is driving out in a brand new car loaded with $23,210. Well done, Flammias."
179,154,1,jpgenius ,I think they should invite the Trans back – “has a boyfriend” and “married” sound VERY similar. But nice retro Feud recaps Bobby.
180,155,1,jpgenius ,"Yipes. Most of Jim’s answers were OK, but too bad they only got single digits."
181,156,1,jpgenius ,Placenta. Deyotta was the only family member who thought it made NO sense. 😂😂😂
182,156,2,jpgenius ,"Jim’s FIVE repeat answers: butt (people), roast beef (steak), women (people), animals (cattle), and football players (people). 😂😂😂"
183,157,1,jpgenius ,Eric said THAT answer with NO hesitation.
184,157,2,jpgenius ,And how did you get these recaps Bobby?
185,157,3,jpgenius ,Nice to see the Traceys win the big money!
186,158,1,jpgenius ,"That’s the second day in a row that Derrick said the “toy”. I mean, for realz?"
187,159,1,FFan99 ,"Didn’t the first question get repeated next season? With the same answers too! Unbelieveable! So Family Feud is so unimaginative that they not only steal past questions, but all the answers too?"
188,163,1,jpgenius ,Three passes in Fast Money? Really? Looks like they were ready to go home after winning the 🚗.
189,163,2,FFan99 ,Finally a car win! Is this the first one this season?
190,166,1,jpgenius ,Gynecologist. 😬
191,169,1,jpgenius ,"This is actually the Wagners’ 3rd game and they now have a 3-day total of $21,575. Nice work, Wagners!"
192,170,1,jpgenius ,That SD question could’ve very well been used in FM.
193,170,2,DAFEWD00 ,"Bobby, sorry to correct you, but for the second question, you left out #2, which was “arm/hand” (14)"
194,172,1,jpgenius ,Madea?!?! 😂😂😂
195,174,1,DAFEWD00 ,"Finger in the butt?! Oh, come on writers, that’s just GROSS! 🤢"
196,176,1,Matthew Yothers ,"You didn’t highlight that in green here, but church was the number one answer for that last question."
197,177,1,jpgenius ,It’s a real bummer that the Bummers never really got to play.
198,177,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, Mike appeared on The Price is Right in 2008. (Well-known for winning his one-bid with a notorious $69 bid.)"
199,178,1,jpgenius ,"On the previous episode, Meg (team captain) KILLED IT in Fast Money. The other Meg got 54, but the captain rallied and got 149! Great work. 👍🏾👍🏾"
200,178,2,jpgenius ,Why did one of the Hallowells burst out singing “Another One Bites the Dust” after Joy said food? 😂😂😂
201,178,3,DAFEWD00 ,"Is it just me, or was that question about the funeral asked later in season 17/18?"
202,179,1,jpgenius ,Saturday? What? That’s a lie.
203,180,1,jpgenius ,Kelly Vander Meer appeared on the 1/23/15 episode of WoF.
204,180,2,jpgenius ,OH MY…if the doctor checks THAT…that’s a lawsuit.
205,181,1,jpgenius ,"Charlie is actually Lisa Consuegra’s (at the time, unborn) son."
206,181,2,jpgenius ,Her poop? Ew…
207,182,1,FEWDLUVR33 ,Wasn’t that the same Pitts family from last season?
208,182,2,Joey Scafetta ,"Yes, that is right."
209,183,1,FEWDLUVR33 ,The #1 answer for the double point question is actually hump.
210,184,1,jpgenius ,Great work Graces. That 🚗 is well deserved!
211,184,2,Matthew Yothers ,"I agree, and also for that earthquake question, if buildings/house was #1, I think #2 would be the ground."
212,184,3,Charles Shen ,When will the recaps of today’s LMAD and TPIR be available?
213,186,1,jpgenius ,This was the first episode where I saw a single-point loss in Fast Money. Poor Singers.
214,187,1,jpgenius ,"Ah, the start of the Newkirks’ adventure."
215,187,2,jpgenius ,The 2 people who said they want their pilot to be a man were probably women. No disrespect.
216,188,1,jpgenius ,"Another painful loss (by 7 points)? Man, the Singers are having it ROUGH!"
217,189,1,FFan99 ,Wouldn’t shoes count as clothes?
218,190,1,jpgenius ,Amanda could’ve just said “himself” for #1. As for Magen’s answer for #2… 😳
219,192,1,ant0824 ,Why you stop posting LMAD results?
220,192,2,jpgenius ,They’ve used that first question before on O’Hurley’s version. The hosts’ reaction to “yeast infection” are very – and I mean VERY – different.
221,193,1,jpgenius ,Sports magazines? No…the answer is OH so obvious.
222,194,1,DAFEWD00 ,"Hey Bobby, you missed an answer on the first question in G1. To name something a woman doesn’t like to see her man playing with, you missed “TV/remote”, which was tied for #4 (meaning it was 4 points)."
223,195,1,jpgenius ,"That’s how you play the Feud: win 5 games, a 🚗, and $42,000+. Great job Newkirks!"
224,195,2,FEWDLUVR3 ,"I’m sorry, PORCUPINE?!"
225,195,3,FEWDLUVR3 ,And how did no one get you/me for the second question in Game 2?!
226,197,1,jpgenius ,Wait…there were only THREE answers in the triple question? That’s rare.
227,201,1,jpgenius ,Kyler didn’t seem too happy losing Sudden Death. At least he and his family came back and won $160K.
228,201,2,ant0824 ,Which the Tournament that the Hutchinsons won have All perfect wins in Fast Money.
229,205,1,jpgenius ,Nice 🚗 win Stewarts.
230,206,1,FFan99 ,The hell kind of last name is Grzywacz
231,207,1,jpgenius ,Keep the 🚗 wins coming. Go Fowlkes family!
232,207,2,Matthew Yothers ,"This season, the Fowlkes family wins the Ford Fusion right away! But darn, another close loss for $20,000 for them, but hey, $22,440 is very respectable despite losing one game the previous season."
233,210,1,jpgenius ,"I thought the last Kevin would be James, NOT Kline."
234,210,2,jpgenius ,"Also, a shoe is not a body part. 😳"
235,212,1,DAFEWD00 ,How was back a dud?
236,213,1,jpgenius ,"I feel READ bad for the McNultys. First, they lose Fast Money by a point and then lose the 🚗. At least they got $22,510."
237,213,2,jpgenius ,"I meant REAL, not read."
238,214,1,jpgenius ,We’ll see the Gates family next season. (Game Show NewsNet made me think their name was Oates with an O. Major typo by them.)
239,217,1,jpgenius ,"Out of all people, Aladdin? And had Roger said pancakes instead, they might have won Fast Money. Ouch."
240,218,1,jpgenius ,That’s the way to do it. Nice work Venus!
241,219,1,DAFEWD00 ,"Snake? Wow, that was just completely random."
242,219,2,Matthew Yothers ,"I found out in a John O’Hurley game that the #1 answer for splashing cologne was actually the face, and that was worth 32 points."
243,222,1,jpgenius ,"The judges did Christine from the Burns family WRONG. On the kissing question, she said flirt, and then the judges asked her to be more specific…and then more specific than THAT. 😳"
244,224,1,jpgenius ,"Sad the Heinsch family never won $20,000, but happy to see them win a 🚗."
245,225,1,jpgenius ,Nice 🚗-winning comeback Marshalls! (Bobby where do you find videos of these episodes?)
246,226,1,jpgenius ,"Harry from the Three Stooges? Huh? Well, the Willigers got themselves a 🚗!"
247,226,2,jpgenius ,"Harry from the Three Stooges? Huh? Well, the Willingers got themselves a 🚗!"
248,228,1,jpgenius ,WOW. Dress size was OH so close…
249,228,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And for the question “A job at the airport” in this survey, the #1 answer was baggage."
250,229,1,jpgenius ,I think they screwed up on the American food question. But it wouldn’t have affected the outcome anyway.
251,231,1,jpgenius ,How did no one get money for the second question (game 2)?
252,234,1,Matthew Yothers ,"There goes the Brown family with their CRAZY $20,000 victory!"
253,235,1,jpgenius ,Zero. 😳
254,237,1,Matthew Yothers ,"In the O’Neal family’s 1st game, I know that they were up against the Kloster family, but they didn’t win Fast Money, and they only finished with $525, but I’m just wondering, what were the Fast Money questions and surveys for that attempt?"
255,237,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Also, I know that Shay was first and Monique was second in Fast Money, since I watched that episode."
256,237,3,Matthew Yothers ,"Also, since I watched that episode earlier, I know that Shay was first and Monique was second in Fast Money."
257,237,4,Matthew Yothers ,"Sorry about the repeat again, my computer is just having problems about my comments coming in."
258,239,1,jpgenius ,"Passing sure was a good strategy for the Easlers. Not once, but twice."
259,239,2,jpgenius ,They deserved that $20K.
260,240,1,jpgenius ,Anthony was probably thinking Hosea for a man’s name that starts with H. So maybe that was a good answer?
261,242,1,jpgenius ,This episode edited out a clip where Darryl Easler claimed Steve Harvey has a big mouth. 😂😂😂
262,243,1,jpgenius ,Charlene got ZERO? 😳
263,243,2,Matthew Yothers ,And Steve was stunned when he saw that potato was up there on that pot question.
264,244,1,THEFEWD77 ,Didn’t they ask the Donald Trump question two seasons later with the Mastrinos?
265,244,2,DAFEWD00 ,Butt paste? 🤣 🤣 🤣
266,245,1,jpgenius ,How was “line” NOT said first?
267,245,2,jpgenius ,"That “walk the ___” question has been used a LOT. On 2/8/2007, this episode, and the Stapletons’ 🚗-winning game."
268,246,1,jpgenius ,This episode actually aired on 3/3/2011.
269,247,1,jpgenius ,People must have been VERY confused when these episodes were skipped.
270,247,2,jpgenius ,"Also, the Webbs could’ve had Delaney say diary or love letters. Not the “toy”. That’s not family-friendly, FAMILY Feud! 😳"
271,248,1,Matthew Yothers ,I think April actually said cleaning for “What do most men expect most women to be really bad at?”
272,248,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And the Gallaghers have a 3-day total of $21,570."
273,249,1,jpgenius ,"K-Y in a hotel?
Your spouse all over you?
A woman’s [BLEEP] is heaven on earth?!?!?!"
274,249,2,GAYMELUVR ,"YEAH, RYAN!"
275,249,3,jpgenius ,He sure made a great run!
276,250,1,jpgenius ,Nichole’s answer to the double-point question was just downright RANDOM. 😳
277,250,2,jpgenius ,"Klines, you had a great $40K run. And Russell Oller said something that had to be bleeped out after seeing his sister’s score in Fast Money."
278,250,3,FEWDLUVR33 ,"It’s okay, Ollers, it’s your first FM."
279,251,1,jpgenius ,I think Josh said job for the first question.
280,252,1,DAFEWD00 ,FYI #3 in question 1 in game 1 was cry.
281,254,1,jpgenius ,Always nice when a family wins $20K on their fourth day. Now off to the 🚗 game the Hartmans go…
282,257,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Wow, Miranda struggled in Fast Money, despite the impressive start on the 1st question."
283,259,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Darn, the Davises missed out on $20,000 by 3 points. Because of the total after three questions, I thought they were gonna win."
284,263,1,jpgenius ,Oh GOSH. This was before Rocco said gynecologist. 😳 At least they didn’t say flush a fish down the toilet. 😂😂😂
285,264,1,jpgenius ,Wait a minute…Cheetos ARE chips.
286,267,1,jpgenius ,WHOA – your SISTER?!?!
287,268,1,jpgenius ,"Happy that the Finch gals won the 🚗, but sad that they never won Fast Money."
288,269,1,jpgenius ,Thank goodness there were FOUR answers to that last question in game 2 instead of six. We know what would’ve been up there if the latter occurred.
289,270,1,DAFEWD00 ,"In Game 1, you forgot “me” as #2, which was 24 points."
290,270,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And I think for the question “a job people have at a nightclub”, despite the different survey, I found out in a Louie Anderson game that Derrick actually had the #1 answer when he said bartender."
291,272,1,jpgenius ,Biting a dog after it bit you is WAY worse than killing it. Can’t you get rabies from that? 😳😱
292,274,1,jpgenius ,How was it a discrepancy?
293,274,2,jpgenius ,Go Whitterns!
294,276,1,FFan99 ,In what universe is changing the radio station or CD wrong?!
295,276,2,jpgenius ,It could be a distraction.
296,279,1,jpgenius ,Pirates ruining a cruise? Could happen.
297,283,1,jpgenius ,"WHOA. Slippery when wet? Four-way intersection? That’s not the first time “slippery when wet” was an answer (O’Hurley question: A traffic sign that describes your first kiss), but where did “four-way intersection” come from? 😳😱"
298,285,1,jpgenius ,"I feel bad the Hartmans didn’t get a 🚗, but they were fun and won 22 grand."
299,285,2,jpgenius ,Something that shakes when it’s turned on…how is THAT #1?
300,286,1,jpgenius ,Most people have fake arms John? 😳😳😳
301,286,2,GSF100 ,Shouldn’t table count as counter
302,286,3,FEWDLUVR3 ,"How is dog #1?! There are so many animals that swim, and they chose DOG as #1?"
303,286,4,jpgenius ,This question has been used before. Weird top answer.
304,287,1,jpgenius ,GO MEG!!!
305,287,2,Matthew Yothers ,"What a FANTASTIC comeback she made for the Lathrops to win $20,000."
306,289,1,Matthew Yothers ,"If I’m thinking right, for the Belling family, Kim #2 was the one who went in the booth."
307,290,1,jpgenius ,Nice job winning that 🚗 Kaysers!
308,290,2,jpgenius ,"Wait a sec – how did these people say that GOD is not more dependable than a man, but something else is?! What has this world come to? 😳"
309,290,3,jpgenius ,"Also, porcupine. 😂"
310,291,1,jpgenius ,"Well, that’s pretty painful. First, the Addisons lose the 🚗 and then the Datchers miss Fast Money by a single point. 😥 If I were to rate this episode like I rate one from Wheel (1-10), I’d give it a 4."
311,291,2,jpgenius ,"And even more painful, the Sudduths miss it by 3 points."
312,291,3,futuresamthegameshow ,I’m surprised Stock Options got 0. It should of gotten 2 points since I’ve heard of it before. Who did they survey?
313,291,4,futuresamthegameshow ,"Huh, your comments aren’t showing up."
314,291,5,Rohan Johnson ,Darn! The Addison Family were so close to win that 🚗
315,292,1,jpgenius ,Nice job in Fast Money Datchers!
316,292,2,jpgenius ,"Oh brother – after the Sudduths painful loss, the Littletons deny them a new 🚗. Yikes. But at least the Littletons won $20K."
317,293,1,jpgenius ,"Dang, the Datchers are KILLIN’ IT!"
318,293,2,jpgenius ,Crazy – Steve jumped right into “Brick House” after he revealed that 24″ was #1. 😂
319,294,1,jpgenius ,"Well, the Datchers sure had a lot of fun and won some big money. $40,995 is a VERY nice take for 3 days."
320,294,2,jpgenius ,What happened to the third question in game 2?
321,294,3,Matthew Yothers ,"Wait, didn’t the Reischel family compete on the Feud earlier in Season 13?"
322,294,4,Matthew Yothers ,"Also, 50 was the #1 answer for “What the heck happened?”"
323,295,1,jpgenius ,Sorry Howards.
324,297,1,jpgenius ,If only Cher said clothes…yipes.
325,298,1,Matthew Yothers ,I thought Texas was the #1 answer for the country music question.
326,299,1,jpgenius ,Wow…the Crisonas didn’t have much of a SHOT. The Arrondo ladies were just too good. 😥
327,300,1,jpgenius ,"So THIS was the first-ever Harvey episode, NOT the one with the Hutchinsons and Praegers."
328,301,1,jpgenius ,"Yipes. A loss by two points. Hey, at least the Darlings are going for the 🚗 next game."
329,302,1,jpgenius ,Yipes. 198 is not a number I’d like to see in Fast Money. Sorry about that Loves.
330,304,1,jpgenius ,"Whoa – $41,375 and the first 🚗 win of the season? The Darling family KILLED IT!"
331,304,2,jpgenius ,"Always nice to see two families win a 🚗 on the same night. $22,970 a great final score for the Morrisons!"
332,304,3,Matthew Yothers ,"And by the way, the remaining #1 answer in that first game was shoes."
333,306,1,jpgenius ,The Georges were here back in Nov. 2009; they lost to the Harris family (who later won a 🚙).
334,307,1,jpgenius ,"It may have taken Sudden Death, but the Abdur-Rahmans have grabbed a 🚗 in their Easter egg hunt!"
335,308,1,jpgenius ,The only reason I can think of for Steve bringing the Speegles back is because he truly enjoys them.
336,308,2,jpgenius ,Artificial…whoa. WHOA. This is a “family” show.
337,308,3,Matthew Yothers ,"Wait, for the article of clothing question, isn’t coat and jacket the same thing?"
338,308,4,Matthew Yothers ,"Also, on YouTube, someone actually thought Family Feud cheated because for Jill’s final answer of French toast, the survey changed from a 36 to a 16."
339,309,1,jpgenius ,"Two $20K wins in a row? Man, the Dunns are on FIRE!"
340,309,2,Matthew Yothers ,The first episode in this recap was the Naked Grandma episode.
341,310,1,jpgenius ,"Toilet seat down? Wow. Well, the Dunns have an even 40 to take home."
342,312,1,Matthew Yothers ,"I’m just wondering, when are you going to release the O’Neal family’s first game (O’Neal vs Kloster) and the game with the Barretts vs the Reischels? I believe those are two more lost episodes."
343,313,1,jpgenius ,Bring on the SHOUTING (from the O’Neals)!
344,313,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Because of Larry’s answers of panties and game show, that was a hilarious final Fast Money for the O’Neal family."
345,317,1,jpgenius ,The Easter Bunny was actually up there. Wow.
346,318,1,jpgenius ,"I think you meant the Dardens, not the Datchers."
347,318,2,jpgenius ,I’m surprised vase was NOT #1.
348,319,1,jpgenius ,No 🚗 for the Fishers? They waited all this time and now this? Rats. At least the Kellys won $20K.
349,319,2,jpgenius ,Here come the Browns. Bringing Tae Kwon Do to the Feud! 😁
350,319,3,Matthew Yothers ,Actually the #1 answer for that married couple question was cars.
351,321,1,jpgenius ,MAN! Sad the Salvatores missed by 5 points.
352,321,2,jpgenius ,"Excuse me, the Coniglios."
353,322,1,jpgenius ,If only Cori said something other than Bar Mitzvah…
354,322,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Or spouse/mate for being more secure, if she would’ve said something other than either one of those, they would’ve won on her birthday."
355,324,1,jpgenius ,That’s disgusting. Smokey Bear peeing on and EATING people?! 😳🤢😱
356,325,1,jpgenius ,"I saw a completely different episode in the first-run group, with the Johnsons (from Florence, SC) playing against the Flams. The Johnsons (this is their 2nd appearance given they lost to the Youngs from Lancaster, OH last February) went from 0 to Sudden Death, won the game, and $20K."
357,325,2,jpgenius ,"Actually, sources tell me Montijo vs. Colbert was supposed to air on the 27th."
358,325,3,jpgenius ,"Kidding, it aired tonight."
359,325,4,jpgenius ,"Wait a second – didn’t we see the first question in the first-run episode before? Like, on 10/17/2016? They’re really running out of ideas… 😳"
360,326,1,jpgenius ,"The Jameses did most of the work, but the Frosts denied them the 🚗 in one fell swoop. YIPES. 😥"
361,327,1,jpgenius ,Aw it’s OK Freemonts. We’ll get em next time.
362,328,1,jpgenius ,"Wow, the Johnsons are on a roll!"
363,329,1,jpgenius ,"The only thing I can say about the final outcome is DANG. It’s great to see the Loves win a 🚗, but it’s heartbreaking to see them miss Fast Money by ONE point. And worse, they missed it by TWO points the previous game. 😥😥😥"
364,329,2,ant0824 ,That gets the rating of a 3
365,329,3,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, unfortunately the Loves weren’t able to win the $20,000 at all, but hey, they’re still leaving with a car, which is better than nothing."
366,330,1,jpgenius ,Go Grays!
367,331,1,DAFEWD00 ,"Whoa, whoa, whoa…KILL him?! 😨 😨 😨"
368,332,1,jpgenius ,"Wow, Jehovah’s Witnesses/a religious group was the top answer? Steve probably thought it would be the Girl Scouts."
369,333,1,jpgenius ,THIS episode is hands down the funniest I’ve seen this season. It left me in some big stitches. 😂😂😂
370,333,2,Katie Rotton ,"This was THE funniest episode I’ve ever seen, at least that I remember! I was in hysterics by the 2nd answer (of 2nd family member) in the FM part! My son actually got off the computer to come see what I was laughing/crying at!  Am looking for it on video…"
371,333,3,Michelle ,What season and episode number was this from?
372,333,4,bobbymgsk ,"This season, but I don’t know the number."
373,333,5,DMK ,"Season 18, Episode 154"
374,333,6,Matthew Yothers ,That was the funniest Fast Money I have ever seen.
375,335,1,jpgenius ,Another 🚗 win? Good job Grays! (And his one was a shutout…)
376,336,1,jpgenius ,Robert must have heard “something people SAY on the street” in FM. Oops.
377,338,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Congrats for winning the $20,000, Davises!"
378,339,1,jpgenius ,Queen Latifah and Madonna should NEVER have been on that list. Period.
379,339,2,TheFeud22 ,"I agree, whoever said those were totally stupid and clearly have never seen their breasts."
380,339,3,DAFEWD00 ,"Me man, you woman?! What the hell kinda answer is that?!"
381,344,1,Matthew Yothers ,"For the question, a type of dip people eat with chips, if French onion was taken, I think #2 would probably be salsa."
382,344,2,jpgenius ,I eat cheddar chips with sour cream. 😋
383,345,1,Matthew Yothers ,"This must be the game that made the Hughes family come back the next season. And also, congratulations on winning $20,000 Vergaras."
384,345,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, bobbymgsk, you forgot another game on the Feud earlier for Group 2, the Barretts vs the Reischels, the Barrett family won the game, they made us laugh a little bit, but they didn’t win, they only picked up $725 in that game."
385,345,3,Matthew Yothers ,"And the members’ names were T.L. Sr., Autumn, Kisha, Heather, and T.L. Jr."
386,345,4,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, Kisha and T.L. Sr. were the two people that did Fast Money in that previous game."
387,346,1,Matthew Yothers ,"For the question, something kids want at bedtime, Rashida actually said a bedtime story, and Safiya had the #1 answer of drink/food, but glass of milk still qualified; still, congratulations to them for winning the $20,000 immediately."
388,346,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Also, that first group game is “Battle of the Sexes” once again."
389,350,1,agusgokil1681 ,"G1: mcfaddens wins $800
G2: klemmers wins $20,000"
390,350,2,jpgenius ,"While I’m glad the Klemmers brought home the bacon to my area 😁, I’m sad to see the Johnsons leave without a 🚗 😢."
391,350,3,FEWDLUVR3 ,E.T. in a basket? Really?!
392,351,1,jpgenius ,"The Hatchers just love taking all the points, don’t they?"
393,352,1,jpgenius ,"GREAT 🚗 + $42,570 win Hatchers! (And BTW Chad lost his shoes on the way to the vehicle.)"
394,352,2,Matthew Yothers ,I think L.A. was what Heather meant when she said California.
395,353,1,jpgenius ,Midgets. 😂😂😂
396,354,1,jpgenius ,You go Shawne!
397,355,1,Matthew Yothers ,"That was the game with Shekira’s long pants moment.
(VB) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzcmF-B9CfE"
398,357,1,jpgenius ,"According to Tiger Droppings, there may have been a discrepancy in the first game: Elham apparently said “old woman” and it counted only as #2."
399,358,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Wow! An even 200 points for the DePalma family to win $20,000. Amazing."
400,359,1,jpgenius ,Zack and Big Mac Attack? Never heard of those before.
401,360,1,jpgenius ,A good sucker Shawne? And how is DOG #1?!
402,363,1,jpgenius ,Best of luck McFaddens!
403,365,1,jpgenius ,A 🚗 win? WTG McFaddens!
404,366,1,Joey Scafetta ,Northside vs. Southside
405,367,1,jpgenius ,No WONDER the Watsons couldn’t steal #4.
406,370,1,Matthew Yothers ,This was the episode in which they paid tribute to Richard Dawson. (RIP to him: 1932-2012)
407,371,1,jpgenius ,"Man, I thought Kristi had it with the closet. This 🚗 loss was REAL painful. 😥 Sorry Webbs."
408,372,1,jpgenius ,MAN. That Ford Fusion would have fit the Browns to a T.
409,372,2,jpgenius ,Yipes.
410,372,3,jpgenius ,Really? The 12-inch item?! 😳🤦🏾‍♂️
411,374,1,jpgenius ,Oh GOSH. THAT answer (from Secily).
412,376,1,jpgenius ,Original triple point question: An animal you associate with a holiday.
413,381,1,DAFEWD00 ,"Whoa, whoa, WHOA! What’s that steamed windows answer supposed to mean?"
414,382,1,jpgenius ,Looks like Holly rushed on the second question. 😂
415,384,1,jpgenius ,Wanda and Lissette: the dream team for 5 days ina. row! Go Cabreras!
416,385,1,jpgenius ,The #3 answer to question 3 was actually pasta.
417,386,1,jpgenius ,Sad to see the Colberts lose the 🚗 in a shutout. But happy to see the McDonalds win the money on Abbie’s birthday.
418,388,1,jpgenius ,"Well, that’s new (the new set)."
419,388,2,jpgenius ,Wait…did Kris say you shouldn’t be afraid to kill a DOG?! 😳🤦🏾‍♂️😡
420,389,1,jpgenius ,"Sorry, Frates family. The Reeds are just too good."
421,391,1,jpgenius ,"Excuse me, Heather, you can’t buzz in yet! Steve didn’t even finish the question (#2)! 😂"
422,392,1,jpgenius ,Wow – the 3 Amigos was a dud? 😳
423,395,1,jpgenius ,I didn’t have a good feeling about the Stroms’ 🚗 game – the Stevensons were just too good.
424,396,1,jpgenius ,I would’ve said George Michael for the last question. RIP George.
425,399,1,jpgenius ,The Keiths are on a roll – 40 grand? Nice!
426,400,1,jpgenius ,"Ebola? Not funny, writers. NOT funny. 😡😡😡"
427,400,2,jpgenius ,"MAN, that sucks. A one-point loss."
428,400,3,jpgenius ,I felt real bad for the Stevensons after seeing that.
429,400,4,jpgenius ,As for Stacey on the first question – Steve was only halfway through and she buzzed in…and pretty much finished his sentence! 😂
430,401,1,jpgenius ,"Welcome back Schneiders. And that means we’ll have to say goodbye to the Hunts. But they won $40,650. A LOT of money for 3 days."
431,401,2,jpgenius ,There you go Stevensons! Now let’s go win some more!
432,404,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Russell had big red comb for that rooster question, but he didn’t know what it was called and was too late."
433,409,1,jpgenius ,OUCH.
434,412,1,jpgenius ,GO Stevensons! 😁
435,414,1,jpgenius ,2 points short? Bummer.
436,414,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Double bummer actually, the Murphy family lost by 2 points, and the Holliday family lost by 16. I’m terribly sorry about that."
437,414,3,jpgenius ,Whoa – PLANE wasn’t up there?!?!
438,414,4,Matthew Yothers ,"I completely agree with that statement, I was really surprised it wasn’t up there, who did they survey?"
439,414,5,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, I thought crane was another good one for that question."
440,414,6,Matthew Yothers ,I think Jackie thought Steve said something that rhymes with the word “stop”.
441,415,1,jpgenius ,GO REGINA!
442,417,1,jpgenius ,I wish we could sneak in another 🚗 game before this season’s over.
443,417,2,jpgenius ,HOLD EVERYTHING – Delton said “clouds” and Crystal said “angel wings”. How did her answer count as “flying/floating” and not his? Bring the Fast family back!
444,417,3,Matthew Yothers ,"Also, if either Steven or Jana would’ve said trunk for the part of the car that you can lock, they would’ve won! Dang it! They needed 54, and trunk would’ve been worth 62."
445,417,4,Eric ,"Fast Family also got robbed on “When flirting w/ a guy, name a part of his body you should lightly touch” when they gave the answer “knee”. This is the same idea as thigh. In addition, when you’re touching the knee, you’re most likely touching the thigh as well."
446,417,5,Matthew Yothers ,"Also, the returning champion family in the 2nd game is not the Lewis family (they were in the 1st game), it’s the Miles family, and this is their 4th time with $21,530."
447,418,1,Rohan Johnson ,"Well, I am sad to see both the Gardners and Willises go."
448,421,1,jpgenius ,Celia (Steve called her Cuckoo) is HILARIOUS. 😂😂😂
449,422,1,FFan99 ,"Wow, three passes on Fast Money? The Sass family needs to stop picking these guys. They REALLY don”t know how Fast Money works."
450,425,1,jpgenius ,That was a CLOSE FM for the Shamshudins. But they got it.
451,425,2,jpgenius ,"Actually, P—- Galore was a James Bond character. That doesn’t excuse the foul language this show uses."
452,426,1,jpgenius ,The Stokelys got VERY lucky with that 🚗 win. The answers to the last question (about rats) could’ve been anything.
453,428,1,jpgenius ,Mini donuts and cheese curds? 🤣
454,431,1,jpgenius ,Very nice job Brick!
455,432,1,jpgenius ,That second question was a REAL stumper. Eight duds?
456,432,2,jpgenius ,GREAT job Luis!
457,432,3,Matthew Yothers ,And the Lennears just doubled their money right on the nose.
458,433,1,jpgenius ,"Um, I dunno if Jay-Z and Lil Wayne would fit into the question about singers kids like to imitate."
459,434,1,jpgenius ,"Darrell, you can’t ring in yet! Steve didn’t even read the question! 😬😂"
460,437,1,jpgenius ,GREAT double 🚗 win.
461,438,1,jpgenius ,"WEIRD Fast Money – oh wait a minute, the Gates are back? Nice."
462,438,2,Matthew Yothers ,And Steve just can’t stand Jenitha again.
463,440,1,jpgenius ,"Ah, the start of the Burgesses’ adventure."
464,440,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And they start their run by getting $20,000 right on the nose."
465,440,3,jpgenius ,"Sorry Beams family. The way things aired (it was skipped), we knew a 🚗 loss was gonna happen. 😥"
466,441,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Wait, weren’t the Johnson family in the Quinn family’s 2nd game the previous year?"
467,442,1,jpgenius ,GO HARTINGS!
468,444,1,jpgenius ,I wish they had Miss Irma play Fast Money. She was HILARIOUS. But great comeback by John!
469,448,1,jpgenius ,"Wait, flirt with BOTH HER parents? I would’ve said flirt with HIS dad."
470,450,1,jpgenius ,I’m a little surprised the Daniels got 149 without getting any top answers.
471,451,1,jpgenius ,"Wow. Just wow. $61,455 is a FANTASTIC total for 5 days. GO Burgesses!"
472,451,2,jpgenius ,"Let’s not forget the Arevalo family from Oct. 2004 ($61,685 – a record?)."
473,451,3,Matthew Yothers ,"$61,455! That’s a new record for the highest 5-day total in the Steve Harvey era. Well done, Burgesses, and congratulations for winning the car, too."
474,451,4,Matthew Yothers ,"Not quite, I just saw the Cole family’s 5th game from 2002, who won $61,755, also in the Richard Karn era, they still hold on to the record after so many years."
475,451,5,jpgenius ,"I just saw it too. They had $60K+ before winning their 5th game, which is unbelievable."
476,451,6,futuresamthegameshow ,"That was UNBELIEVABLE! First time I’ve ever seen $60,000. I hope Ismael sees this."
477,453,1,jpgenius ,"ANOTHER woman Rob? TMI! It’s “a man”, not “a MARRIED man”! LOL."
478,453,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Oh, darn, the Tattersalls put up another shocking loss by 2 points."
479,454,1,jpgenius ,I didn’t think she gave all the top answers. Nice work!
480,454,2,jpgenius ,"Actually, Torquesia DIDN’T get the last #1 answer, Janine did (Internet). Still, great job!"
481,454,3,FirstDarla ,"I see you don’t monetize your blog, don’t waste your traffic,
you can earn additional bucks every month because you’ve got

482,455,1,jpgenius ,WHOA – you can’t say THOSE answers to the “other woman” question on TV! Like #1!
483,460,1,Bob ,“Name something BAD about a guy that DOESN’T show up in a photo.”
484,461,1,jpgenius ,Not very often you see two families from St. Paul.
485,462,1,Rohan Johnson ,Great job in Fast Money Noris Family! 💵😁
486,463,1,jpgenius ,"Sorry Krals. But when I read the recaps, I saw it coming given the Gants appeared the following season."
487,463,2,Rohan Johnson ,"Yup, first the Kral Family lose the car, and then the Giants miss by 11 points in FM."
488,465,1,jpgenius ,Save the whales is #1? Wow.
489,469,1,jpgenius ,"Man, I hate seeing a family losing the 🚗 twice. I hope the Hughes family still had fun."
490,469,2,Matthew Yothers ,"I agree, and it’s also painful to see the Allen family miss out on another $20,000 by 5 points."
491,469,3,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, on the other hand, the Hughes family still left with $21,775, which is better than nothing."
492,470,1,jpgenius ,Not very often you see an all-military family like the Vernons.
493,471,1,jpgenius ,It’s OK Hodges. It’s your first Fast Money.
494,473,1,jpgenius ,Selena (Brooks family) was on Wheel back in 2011 (Best of the Best).
495,474,1,DAFEWD00 ,"Welcome back, Goulds."
496,475,1,jpgenius ,"Wow…had Jamila said spouse instead of teacher, she would’ve gotten all the top answers. Great shot at it though."
497,477,1,jpgenius ,"“Kayla says…” Kayla, this is Family Feud, not the Kayla Show. 😂"
498,477,2,jpgenius ,"Also, Emma repeated the first 4 answers. FM is not as easy as it looks, folks."
499,479,1,jpgenius ,ONE?!?! Who did they interview?
500,479,2,jpgenius ,For pregnant women.
501,480,1,DAFEWD00 ,"Man, I hate seeing the Goulds lose the 🚗. You still did very good though."
502,480,2,jpgenius ,Was Xavier Prather the same person who just won Big Brother?
503,482,1,Matthew Yothers ,Unbelievable! The Hughes family had all of the #1 answers and they still lost.
504,482,2,jpgenius ,Bummer.
505,482,3,jpgenius ,Potato – WHAT?! 😳
506,484,1,jpgenius ,“He’s white.” 😂😂😂
507,484,2,Rohan Johnson ,"Well, I’m sad to see the Feltons go 😢, but I’m happy to see the Hughes win $20,000 💵👍."
508,485,1,jpgenius ,Aw no car for the Hughes?
509,486,1,jpgenius ,"The thing on his back? Not specific enough, DJ."
510,486,2,jpgenius ,Brandon’s just what the Siureks needed! Now let’s see if they win the 🚗…
511,487,1,jpgenius ,GO TINA!!! 😁
512,487,2,jpgenius ,"Had she gotten the top answer to #2, she still would’ve missed by a point. WOW. It’s hard getting 200 by yourself."
513,488,1,jpgenius ,Nice work John!
514,488,2,jpgenius ,The Stapletons’ first FM.
515,489,1,jpgenius ,Oh boy – get ready for the shouting AGAIN (the Moffetts won $20K previously). 😁
516,489,2,jpgenius ,"Don’t wanna offend anybody here, but I have something to say about “bi/crazy for c——“. The day this aired was actually the first time I EVER heard the C-word and I thought it was a nickname. For a PERSON. Honest."
517,490,1,jpgenius ,The highlight of this episode was the Wardlaws’ performance. They’re gospel music recording artists.
518,492,1,jpgenius ,"This was actually the Flams, not the Slagles."
519,493,1,jpgenius ,This game actually went to Sudden Death.
520,494,1,jpgenius ,MAN…I wanted the Moffetts to win the 🚗. But they got $41K+.
521,494,2,Andrew ,You must tell me which season and episode this is from. I’m having the hardest time finding It!
522,494,3,Rohan Johnson ,This is from Season 16 Episode 21.
523,495,1,jpgenius ,Welcome back Rosados.
524,495,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Yes, welcome back, guys. And also, for the question “something people do when they have extra time in the morning”, sleep and eat should be TIED for the #1 answer."
525,495,3,Matthew Yothers ,"Ouch, what a double-shocking performance, the Gardners lost the car, and the Rodgers lost $20,000 by 2 points."
526,496,1,jpgenius ,"Eric: “I shake my kids.”
Tajuana: “What?!”"
527,496,2,jpgenius ,Should’ve seen the McCarthys dance after winning FM. 😂
528,499,1,jpgenius ,Rats. Missed by 9. At least the Quinns won a 🚗.
529,499,2,jpgenius ,"Also, his minister? And DOOKIE?!"
530,502,1,jpgenius ,Missing by two points…and then eight? Yipes.
531,502,2,jpgenius ,I’m shocked. Only 10 sit-ups?! You should’ve seen the look on Stephanie’s face when that was announced. 😳
532,503,1,jpgenius ,GO MICHELLE!!!
533,505,1,jpgenius ,Kicking his kids? Really?
534,505,2,jpgenius ,Oh BROTHER. The Lacys are here.
535,506,1,DAFEWD00 ,"Masturbating, D? Really? O_O"
536,508,1,jpgenius ,"THAT’S how you play the Feud: $42,760 and a 🚗. WTG Sturinos!"
537,508,2,Matthew Yothers ,"I agree, and they deserved to win it, too, also, they put an end to the really long streak without a car win in Group 1. Amazing!"
538,509,1,jpgenius ,Why would you tell anyone that you’re sleeping with a coworker? TMI! 😳
539,510,1,jpgenius ,GO Caauwes!
540,511,1,jpgenius ,I was just watching the Cossalters’ first FM attempt.
541,513,1,jpgenius ,Great 🚗 win Caauwes!
542,513,2,Matthew Yothers ,"I also noticed that Jack from the Brinson family is an Eagle Scout, explaining the belt he’s wearing."
543,513,3,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, I just became an Eagle Scout as well."
544,515,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Wow! That’s another $20,000 to the Campbell family."
545,515,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, I found that thread was given by Lindsey when she said needle and thread, but needle was the first thing she said, so the judges gave her just needle."
546,517,1,Matthew Yothers ,"For the question “Something a dog sees that causes it to bark its head off”, the #1 answer is actually strangers/people."
547,521,1,jpgenius ,If I EVER see “float a dookie” on this show one more time…that is foul. 🙄😳
548,521,2,jpgenius ,Wait a second – Dana and Linda switched places after the first survey? But why? 😳
549,522,1,jpgenius ,Nice work there Budas!
550,522,2,jpgenius ,"WOW – after three FM losses, the Stocktons finally hit paydirt! Fantastic. 😁"
551,523,1,jpgenius ,GREAT work David! 👍🏾👍🏾
552,524,1,jpgenius ,Sucks to see the Mastrinos lose the 🚗 again.
553,524,2,Matthew Yothers ,"I agree, and I also feel bad to see the Silers lose on their second day. On the other hand, they did win $20,000 in their first game."
554,524,3,Matthew Yothers ,And I also liked it when Steve noticed that the Mastrino brothers were wearing Steve Harvey suits.
555,525,1,jpgenius ,"The Maloofs are on a ROLL! Also, condoms?!?!"
556,526,1,jpgenius ,Aw rats. I wanted the Campbells to win the 🚗.
557,526,2,Matthew Yothers ,"I agree, but on the bright side, they’re still leaving with $41,295. That’s not bad."
558,526,3,Matthew Yothers ,"Plus, I think it’s good enough to actually buy a car though."
559,526,4,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, for that letter of the alphabet question, I thought L was going to be #1, but it’ll definitely be up there, too, maybe it’ll be the 2nd highest answer."
560,528,1,jpgenius ,Aw rats. No 🚗 for the Stocktons?
561,528,2,jpgenius ,"How ironic. The Steeles shut out the Fowlkes, and then the Fowlkes do the same to the Steeles."
562,528,3,Matthew Yothers ,What a turnover for them!
563,528,4,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, Noureyah, what an amazing comeback from your first attempt in Fast Money, even though you just didn’t get enough for another $20,000."
564,529,1,jpgenius ,22 and 7. Too young! 😳😂
565,529,2,FEWDLUVR3 ,I’m probably gonna guess the #1 answer to the last FM Q in Game #2 is knife.
566,529,3,DAFEWD00 ,"Either that, or gun. Does someone have the answer?"
567,531,1,jpgenius ,"Lucy must have gotten REAL giddy when she heard the double-point question, given was all too excited to answer “dancer” and share her Chippendale’s story. 😳😬"
568,533,1,jpgenius ,"When Steve asked Alexis about her dad Derick dressing her, Shae jumped in and said that Derick was her ex. Another “no feud in this family” moment."
569,533,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Wow, as of right now, this is the 1st time we’ve had not 1, but 2 car winning families as 2 brand new teams."
570,533,3,jpgenius ,And then the Matkins and Mossers broke that record with 4 in a row.
571,535,1,jpgenius ,How six and mouthwash didn’t score any points is beyond me.
572,537,1,jpgenius ,"Echoes of Jeff Pippin’s “sister” answer, but worse – his mom and the dog were also given. 😰"
573,537,2,jpgenius ,"Also, a woman has to be licked, Gene?"
574,537,3,jpgenius ,Sources tell me that the Stuerkes appeared on the Combs version and won $17K+ over 5 games. Too bad they walked out empty-handed this time around.
575,538,1,jpgenius ,WTG Chris! BTW Tyler’s known as Ninja on Halo.
576,538,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Yes, Ninja starts his run here."
577,538,3,jpgenius ,"Also, just because it’s Panda Express doesn’t mean they serve panda."
578,538,4,DAFEWD00 ,How did NO ONE get frog legs?!
579,540,1,jpgenius ,This day was a VERY good day in game shows.
580,541,1,jpgenius ,"Dang, the Blevins have gotten HOT – $40,760!"
581,541,2,jpgenius ,Another adventure begins – GO Circuits!
582,541,3,jpgenius ,And – why would a cheapskate give his mistress THAT? 😳
583,542,1,jpgenius ,"I remember watching this episode (the first I saw with the Blevins). Sad to see the Blevins go, but Jason Beams’ FM answer was HILARIOUS. Mother-in-law?! 😂🤣"
584,542,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Jason: Not MY mother-in-law.
Steve: No (how many times), not MY mother-in-law. (mocking Jason)"
585,542,3,Matthew Yothers ,"Yeah, but they still left with $40,760. WTG Ninja and the Blevinses."
586,542,4,jpgenius ,"Oh brother – first gerbil, now intimacy (hot and dirty) and Barney Rabbit."
587,543,1,jpgenius ,WHO would trade their husband for THAT (Todd’s answer)?! 😳
588,544,1,jpgenius ,I didn’t know zombies are black. 😳
589,544,2,Matthew Yothers ,Another funny Family Feud moment right there.
590,544,3,Matthew Yothers ,"I’m just curious, what does the G.O. mean in Fast Money?"
591,544,4,GMS1000 ,Probably Get Out or Game Over
592,544,5,Matthew Yothers ,"Yeah, I think it means game over, too, thanks for pointing that out GMS1000."
593,545,1,jpgenius ,"The Circuits have gotten HOT – $40,950!"
594,545,2,jpgenius ,“My dancing d—”…only two people could’ve said that.
595,546,1,DAFEWD00 ,How did baked goods score nothing?
596,547,1,jpgenius ,"The Beams have gotten REAL HOT – $41,450 HOT!"
597,547,2,jpgenius ,GO CIRCUITS!!! Go on and claim your 🚗!
598,548,1,jpgenius ,Meagan and Dustin: the dream team for two days in a row!
599,548,2,jpgenius ,Great job winning that 🚗 Griers!
600,549,1,jpgenius ,The Byrds’ catchphrase: “Birds of a feather flock together!” And they had the feathers to prove it.
601,550,1,jpgenius ,Nice job Reeds! But…Charlie tore his Achilles’ tendon while celebrating. OUCH.
602,550,2,Joseph McGill ,"On the jersey shore, condoms are most commonly referred to as ‘JIMMY-HAT’ .  "
603,551,1,DAFEWD00 ,Poor Charlie…being confined to a wheelchair after last night’s FM win. 😞 😢
604,551,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Actually, he had crutches for the rest of their run."
605,554,1,jpgenius ,DOGGONE IT.
606,555,1,jpgenius ,How did Rodney King get zero?
607,555,2,FEWDLUVR3 ,"Wow, three skips on the second Fast Money? They really shouldn’t have picked Kenny."
608,556,1,jpgenius ,"There you go, White family."
609,556,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Yes, and well done to you, too, Ames family, for winning $20,000, and getting all of the #1s."
610,557,1,jpgenius ,WHOA there – Cinderella didn’t drink alcohol.
611,558,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Wow! What a win for the Keefe family. They won $20,000 right on the head."
612,558,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, in reality, cats sleep between 12 and 16 hours a day."
613,559,1,jpgenius ,Ervin (when Steve was fixing his tie): “Steve Harvey is touching me!”
614,560,1,jpgenius ,"Well, THIS is interesting: Dottie and Robert are divorcees, and Kendrah is his new wife."
615,561,1,jpgenius ,Just because Cheryl said 30 doesn’t mean 31 is up there.
616,561,2,jpgenius ,I remember being as nervous as Steve during the 6-/12-in. question.
617,562,1,jpgenius ,The Rieckenbergs sure had quite a run.
618,563,1,jpgenius ,Steve was just WAITING for someone to say THAT answer (first question).
619,563,2,DAFEWD00 ,IDIOT?!
620,563,3,jpgenius ,That answer is so out of left field… 😂😂😂
621,565,1,jpgenius ,Bring on the SHOUTING (from the Moffetts)!
622,565,2,jpgenius ,GREAT 🚗-winning comeback Siureks!
623,567,1,jpgenius ,What? San Quentin? Why?
624,567,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Darn! They had all #1 answers and they still lost. Sorry, Rollysons."
625,567,3,Matthew Yothers ,"On the other hand, the Eligon family had all #1 answers and they DID win $20,000, giving them a 2-day total of $40,000."
626,570,1,Matthew Yothers ,"In the military parade question, Brandy said stop, which obviously is the same as halt."
627,571,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Darn, the Siurek family missed out on $20,000 by just 2 points."
628,572,1,jpgenius ,Game 2: I think the #1 answer to the last FM question was clothes.
629,572,2,Merton Kreps ,"No, home and apartment was number one."
630,575,1,jpgenius ,Wow…first FM loss and Sudden Death question this season already. Those events don’t happen often on the Celebrity Feud.
631,581,1,jpgenius ,"I think I know the censored answer Velvet Sky gave…but I’m not at liberty to say it. This is Family Feud, Velvet! 😳😂"
632,585,1,jpgenius ,Uh-oh…echoes of the Pillsbury Doughboy in the Bieber/Trump question. 😂😂😂
633,589,1,jpgenius ,"A COSTUME?! And handcuffs?! Dang, the Feud’s gotten raunchy."

639,598,1,jpgenius ,"YES! The Donaldsons win 5 games, $22,885, a 🚗…they did AWESOME."
640,599,1,jpgenius ,This episode was HILARIOUS.
641,599,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Wait a minute, the croupier is another word for a dealer, so they actually had all of the #1s in this 2nd Fast Money."
642,600,1,jpgenius ,Now THAT was just painful to watch. 😥
643,601,1,jpgenius ,"Sad to see the Sasses lose the 🚗 after that heartbreaking FM, but happy to see the Lennears win $20K."
644,602,1,jpgenius ,"Given both Joe Reed and Joey Kelly are both dancers, I wish they had a dance-off."
645,602,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Also, that episode was Steve’s 2-time Emmy winning special."
646,602,3,Matthew Yothers ,And didn’t the Kellys cause a car repo in the premiere of the previous season?
647,603,1,jpgenius ,Sad to see the Reeds lose the 🚗. Could’ve been 3 wins in a row (after the Siureks and Griers).
648,603,2,DAFEWD00 ,I agree. Who would’ve EVER thought of POTATO as the final answer?!
649,603,3,DAFEWD00 ,Who even EATS potato skins?
650,603,4,jpgenius ,"Well, think of potato skins."
651,604,1,jpgenius ,I believe Belva said “a better body”.
652,612,1,jpgenius ,A well-deserved win for the Hutchinson brothers!
653,613,1,jpgenius ,"Well, THAT’S painful – 199 points. At least they won $10K and not $995."
654,615,1,jpgenius ,"Wow. All it took was a 🚗 win, and the Reyes finally win the money! Great work!"
655,618,1,jpgenius ,A CONDOM is #1?!?! 😳🤦🏾‍♂️
656,619,1,jpgenius ,Making whoopee on your cheating husband’s body? That’s disgusting. 😳😰
657,620,1,jpgenius ,"Both episodes were funny, but the first one… 😂😂😂"
658,621,1,jpgenius ,This is pretty painful to watch. 😥
659,621,2,Rohan Johnson ,"Yup, The Tuckers were so close to winning that $20,000. They missed by 5 points, but let’s look on the bright side. They still have $41,680, and that’s actually good enough for them to pay for car. And I’m also happy to see the Docks win $20,000 on their first game."
660,622,1,Ant1988 ,"The premiere episodes of this season started with a dismal 117 in G1 fast money, but won it in Game 2. 1 and 1 in fast money this season."

662,623,1,jpgenius ,Nice work in FM Tuckers!
663,624,1,jpgenius ,"Boy, we’ve had some funny, crazy and loud families already. Like the Roccos."
664,624,2,jpgenius ,Steve: “Kansas. It’s completely flat.” 😂
665,625,1,jpgenius ,The Tuckers have been full of crazy answers.
666,626,1,jpgenius ,Kiss your boss’…whoa. WHOA there Sydney. 😳
667,628,1,jpgenius ,Did Steve really have trouble pronouncing the Salehzadehs’ name?
668,629,1,jpgenius ,"Wow, no 🚗 for the Docks, huh? 😭"
669,630,1,jpgenius ,Sad to see the Masseys lose the 🚗. But this was a pretty good first week.
670,630,2,Matthew Yothers ,"The Masseys would’ve deserved it too if they won, but they still left with $41,600."
671,630,3,jpgenius ,"Besides, both the Masseys AND the Chambers were hilarious. "
672,631,1,jpgenius ,"Um Larry, I don’t think you should say that answer (in question 1) on TV. 😳"
673,632,1,jpgenius ,Always nice to see 2 $20K wins in one night. But Braden’s foul language though… 😳
674,632,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Wait, where in the 2nd game did you notice that?"
675,633,1,jpgenius ,Kenyala said she’d trade her husband for BREAD 🍞 – and then agreed with Jody when he said shoes. WOW. 😳😂
676,634,1,jpgenius ,TOASTER OVEN?!?! 😳😰🤢
677,634,2,ant0824 ,No wonder they lost in the Fast Money.
678,634,3,jpgenius ,Who throws a toaster oven at her husband? She’ll be on Snapped!
679,635,1,jpgenius ,GO COXES!!!
680,635,2,Matthew Yothers ,"In the Washburns’s Fast Money, we have a new record getting three ties for the #1 answer in a row."
681,635,3,jpgenius ,That’s very unusual.
682,636,1,jpgenius ,Very interesting that both of these episodes had a family going from 0 to Sudden Death and the winning teams earning $20K.
683,638,1,jpgenius ,OUCH. Sad to see the brothers miss by 2 points.
684,640,1,jpgenius ,Things sure got crazy with the Ereksons and Zoets.
685,642,1,Matthew Yothers ,I thought a parka is a coat.
686,642,2,Matthew Yothers ,And I was also thinking Louie Anderson for the famous Anderson.
687,642,3,Matthew Yothers ,I guess I have to say this. RIP Louie Anderson. The Family Feud crew back then and the crew right now will never forget you.
688,642,4,Matthew Yothers ,So Joelle actually DID have the #1 answer for that Eskimo question.
689,643,1,Dulce ,yes
690,643,2,jpgenius ,$40K in 2 days? The Ereksons are on a roll! And 3rd time’s the charm for the Noyolas.
691,645,1,jpgenius ,"Dang, the Noyolas are on FIRE! Now let’s see them win that 🚗. I think an answer involving hair in the Cucinottas’ 1st game brought them back."
692,645,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Yeah, I was about to say, the Cucinotta family is definitely familiar."
693,647,1,jpgenius ,"Wow. Always nice to see 2 🚗 wins in a row. Great 5-day run, Nelsons!"
694,647,2,Matthew Yothers ,And Andrew also shocked Steve in Sudden Death resulting in the car win.
695,647,3,dylanjgameshows ,"As old Barker said when Joy SOMEHOW managed to win the car in 10 Chances… “I can’t believe it. I can’t believe that happened! I can’t believe it!” Steve was right. We DID see a miracle. For those who don’t know, Andrew was getting strikes all week, so to see him FINALLY get an answer on the board (the one
that won them the car), and in SD no less, is AMAZING. WTG, Nelsons! I know this is from 5+ years ago, but still."
696,648,1,Charles Shen ,There is a 5 time Champion today?
697,648,2,jpgenius ,GO NOYOLAS! Grab that 🚗!
698,650,1,jpgenius ,GO EREKSONS! 😁
699,650,2,jpgenius ,"Oh, and the Newmans left in stitches."
700,650,3,jpgenius ,Left me (or all of us) in stitches.
701,653,1,jpgenius ,"Good match between two fun families, but the hometown team (the Kellys) came out on top!"
702,655,1,jpgenius ,You go Vernard!
703,657,1,jpgenius ,Licorice (George) and Poundcake (Will). What a duo.
704,658,1,jpgenius ,Your marriage. YIKES. 😳😬
705,659,1,jpgenius ,"GO GANTS!!! 🚗 And boy, the Fabianos are winning BIG! 💵"
706,660,1,Matthew Yothers ,Big Game James makes his debut here.
707,660,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, I think you made another error with the #1s; for the question “Something people ride when they need a barf bag,” I found out that roller coaster/amusement ride was #1."
708,661,1,jpgenius ,"Here come the Grangers! Dang, we’ve seen some exciting families, haven’t we?"
709,661,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Yes we have, and also bobbymgsk, you forgot to mention that Kyle is also in the Air Force."
710,662,1,jpgenius ,"Well, DANG, Kevin. You can’t say THAT on TV. 😳"
711,663,1,jpgenius ,"Ah, the start of the Henrys’ adventure. 😁"
712,664,1,jpgenius ,All this week’s families were crazy fun. Too bad this game didn’t go to Sudden Death.
713,664,2,jpgenius ,How did King David get ZERO? 😳😡
714,665,1,jpgenius ,More comedy gold with the Henrys…with Terree revealing her hair under her weave. I didn’t see it coming. 😏
715,665,2,jpgenius ,"Also, police officer, Kenny? YIKES."
716,666,1,jpgenius ,188 points? GO KENNY!!! 👍🏾👍🏾
717,667,1,jpgenius ,THAT FM was painful. 😳 At least it wasn’t 5 zeroes.
718,667,2,Rohan Johnson ,Wow. It sucks to see the Grangers miss by 24 points on FM.
719,668,1,jpgenius ,"“Your place or mine.”
“What looks good on you is me.”"
720,669,1,jpgenius ,"Geez, the Grangers are KILLIN’ IT! That’s 41,715 reasons (and counting) why they‘re so good! Now go win that 🚗 tomorrow!"
721,669,2,ant0824 ,No wonder the Grangers are on a roll. Go for a Car win. And why you’re not commenting on Wheel of fortune this season?
722,669,3,jpgenius ,I’ve been so busy. I’ll comment when I get the chance.
723,669,4,jpgenius ,I’ll comment very soon. Starting this weekend.
724,670,1,jpgenius ,YES!!! GO HENRYS!!! 🚗👍🏾👍🏾
725,670,2,futuresamthegameshow ,Missed it by 9.
726,671,1,jpgenius ,GO GRANGERS!!! 🚗
727,671,2,ant0824 ,Grangers Car win! Family feud rating: 8. Not such for Wheel Today my rating on wheel a 2
728,671,3,Matthew Yothers ,"GO GET THAT CAR, GRANGERS, and thank you for your service, “Comeback” Kyle."
729,671,4,Bob ,That girl said “titties” lol
730,671,5,jpgenius ,I knew it was coming. I just KNEW it was coming.
731,671,6,Matthew Yothers ,Kyle said “Tiebreaker is all I could think of” after the 2nd FM question.
732,671,7,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, for the dog and cat question, I would’ve said either four legs or a tail."
733,671,8,Matthew Yothers ,"Or should I say, I would’ve ALSO said either four legs or a tail."
734,674,1,jpgenius ,"REP the Bay, Godwins! (They’re from Antioch.)"
735,674,2,jpgenius ,Wait…register for to vote…makes NO sense.
736,675,1,jpgenius ,Phillip’s answer to the last question was FAR better than #3.
737,675,2,jpgenius ,"REP the Bay, Graves! (They’re from Santa Rosa.)"
738,676,1,jpgenius ,Oklahoma vs. Minnesota made for some interesting matches tonight.
739,678,1,jpgenius ,Sad to see the Berrys lose by 7. But the Johnsons seem like good players!
740,679,1,jpgenius ,"The Crooks and McPhails are VERY talented, with the Elizabeth and Kristin’s tap dance and the Crooks’ gospel song. 👍🏾👍🏾"
741,679,2,Matthew Yothers ,"I agree, they were 2 very talented families, and also, congratulations to the Johnson family for starting their run with $20,000."
742,679,3,Matthew Yothers ,I thought there were 4 states that start with “New”.
743,679,4,jpgenius ,Me too! Here’s another top answer mistake: the biggest state. The #1 answer was Texas (instead of Alaska)!
744,679,5,Matthew Yothers ,"I agree with you again, Texas is actually the 2nd largest state overall."
745,680,1,jpgenius ,"Fun pair of episodes, and I sure hope the Berrys win the 🚗 tomorrow. That’ll be 2 straight OK families winning the 🚗."
746,681,1,jpgenius ,"The Johnsons have gotten HOT – for 40,000 reasons! 😳😁"
747,681,2,Matthew Yothers ,"For that 80-year-old man question, Steve actually went to Hayward for the steal."
748,682,1,jpgenius ,"Mixed emotions. Sad to see the Berrys lose the 🚗, but great to see the Weatherlys come back and win $20K!"
749,683,1,jpgenius ,"The Johnsons haven’t gotten to play much, but maybe that’s a strategy. Smart."
750,685,1,jpgenius ,Looks like we’ve got a car game doubleheader tomorrow. Nice!
751,686,1,jpgenius ,"That was a close call for the Weatherlys, but I’m SO glad they won a 🚗 AND another $20,000! 😁"
752,686,2,David Barton ,Why does he tell the family that lost the buzzer rang it’s too late but the family that won when the buzzer rang he let them answer I don’t get it
753,686,3,Matthew Yothers ,"I don’t know, but congratulations to the Weatherly family for coming back after 2 years to win the car and $41,810. Well done to them!"
754,687,1,jpgenius ,"Great job Bulbuks! And it’s OK, Deckers. You’ll be back tomorrow."
755,688,1,jpgenius ,The Brays drove me crazy. Pig mail? What’s that?! 😂😂😁 At least they won $20K.
756,688,2,jpgenius ,"Geez, this will make Monday’s episode the SIXTH (and likely final) 🚗 game this month! The Bulbuks have REALLY gotten hot – $41,565? I’ll take it! 😁"
757,688,3,jpgenius ,This was for tonight’s episode. Sorry.
758,689,1,jpgenius ,WTG Johnsons! 🚗
759,689,2,Matthew Yothers ,"I agree, and for the famous Jimmy/Jimmie question, I thought Jimmie Johnson was a good answer, he’s a famous race car driver."
760,689,3,jpgenius ,They also snubbed Jimmy Buffett and Jimi Hendrix. 🤦🏾‍♂️
761,689,4,Matthew Yothers ,"And actually, Austen didn’t do Fast Money at all, they actually got Lauten back in the group in their final attempt."
762,690,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Lots more money being given away, I think everybody really wants to win $20,000 this season."
763,691,1,jpgenius ,"Geez, this will make Monday’s episode the SIXTH (and likely final) 🚗 game this month! The Bulbuks have REALLY gotten hot – $41,565? I’ll take it! 😁"
764,691,2,Mitchell Hodack ,"I thought the Latu family of Fort Worth, Texas won the game. Did they win or lose to the Bray family?"
765,693,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Wow, David did really well and helped the Doughty family win $20,000, and also for the question, “Something you hope a houseguest doesn’t turn on in the middle school of the night, I’m surprised that the lights wasn’t #1."
766,694,1,jpgenius ,WOO HOO!! GO BULBUKS!!!! 🚗👍🏾👍🏾
767,694,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Wow, another Battle of the Sexes in this first game."
768,695,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Really, Turrentines? Clumsy and Moby?"
769,697,1,jpgenius ,"Both of tonight’s games were fun. The Nothelfers drove me CRAZY again 😂, and we had a Ms. America winner and an on-stage engagement. 😁❤️"
770,697,2,jpgenius ,But sad to see the Reeds miss by 4. 😥
771,697,3,Matthew Yothers ,"Agreed, and I also feel bad to see the Barrets lose by 20."
772,697,4,Tony Lopes ,What year was Miss America ‘Shirley”
773,697,5,jpgenius ,"According to Wikipedia, 1975."
774,699,1,jpgenius ,"Another double 🚗 win. Lorenzens and Doughtys, you absolutely KILLED IT! 👍🏾👍🏾"
775,699,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Man, Steve has given away a lot of money and cars on the feud."
776,700,1,jpgenius ,I think the last question in game 2 was odd. Doesn’t “move to another state” sorta count as “travel”?
777,701,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Wow, 2 $20,000 wins again, we’re having another lucky day on the Feud!"
778,701,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, we’ve REALLY gotta stop having liars in our surveys. The first question, “We asked 100 men, on a scale of 1 to 10, how dirty is your mind,” they said a 5 for that one."
779,702,1,jpgenius ,"Legs, Tina? 😳🤔😂"
780,703,1,jpgenius ,OH MY…the first question in game 2 was SO inappropriate. 😳😰
781,704,1,jpgenius ,A pole for the bedroom and groin hair?!?! 😳😰
782,705,1,jpgenius ,"Wow, the Nguyens and Caters have gotten HOT – especially the Nguyens! If both win on Monday, we’ll have our second doubleheader (our 10th and 11th 🚗 games) this season!"
783,706,1,jpgenius ,YES! The Nguyens are going for a 🚗 tomorrow!
784,707,1,ant0824 ,Congratulations to the Nguyens on winning the Car!
785,707,2,jpgenius ,"GO NGUYENS!!! Too bad they missed by 15 in FM, but they won the 🚗!"
786,708,1,jpgenius ,These two episodes were FUNNY. 😂😂😂
787,708,2,jpgenius ,"Also, it’s ironic they asked the wet weather question given it’s raining in SF right now!"
788,708,3,ant0824 ,And also Both Fast Money games were Won
789,708,4,jpgenius ,A good night on the Feud.
790,709,1,jpgenius ,"Anchorage.
Steve vs. Jimmy.
Pamela at the buzzer."
791,710,1,jpgenius ,This whole week has been hilarious. 😂 And good luck to the Kendricks in Monday’s 🚗 game!
792,711,1,jpgenius ,"Sad to see the Kendricks lose the 🚗, but great job in FM by the Patels and Cassillys!"
793,711,2,jpgenius ,I think the Kendricks might just get another shot because of the sidewalk/driveway fiasco.
794,711,3,jpgenius ,Marian did FANTASTIC! 👍🏾👍🏾
795,712,1,jpgenius ,More comedy gold! ESPECIALLY in the second game! 😂
796,713,1,jpgenius ,Danielle has two legs; one of them’s just broken.
797,713,2,Matthew Yothers ,Those married women are definitely lying in that emergency question.
798,714,1,jpgenius ,"The Combs are from OKC. And ladies and gentlemen, MORE humor from this family and the Clays. 😂😂😂"
799,714,2,Matthew Yothers ,Too bad they didn’t win the money though.
800,715,1,jpgenius ,Tummy tuck. That’s all.
801,716,1,jpgenius ,GREAT car win Clays! 🚗
802,717,1,jpgenius ,HILARIOUS 2 episodes. 😂
803,718,1,jpgenius ,The last 2 fall episodes continued with the comedy gold.
804,719,1,Matthew Yothers ,I’d really like to see another carheader possibly coming up later on.
805,719,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And by that, I mean car doubleheader."
806,719,3,jpgenius ,I sure got a nice birthday present. GO Mitchells and Wilkins! 👍🏾👍🏾
807,720,1,jpgenius ,"Sad to see the Mitchells and Wilkins go, but their opponents seem like a whole lotta fun."
808,721,1,jpgenius ,This set of episodes… 😂
809,721,2,Matthew Yothers ,I think Kristin realized she made a mistake on that airplane question in FM.
810,722,1,jpgenius ,Very nice job Demarests! 👍🏾👍🏾
811,722,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And congratulations Demarests for finally winning the $20,000."
812,723,1,jpgenius ,Fun episodes. I can’t wait to see the Macks and Patels tomorrow. 👍🏾👍🏾
813,724,1,jpgenius ,The Beckmans. That’s all. 😂
814,724,2,Pervis ,What an embarrassment for MN. Hockey roid-rage boys and idiot-arrogant parents. Yep that is about right.
815,725,1,jpgenius ,HILARIOUS episodes.
816,725,2,jpgenius ,Wait…extreme pogo stick?! 😳😂
817,726,1,jpgenius ,"Well, the Hubers can join the Beckmans in the long list of crazy fun families we saw this season."
818,727,1,jpgenius ,"The second episode with the Frosts was fun, but the FIRST one – WOW."
819,728,1,jpgenius ,MAN.
820,728,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Gosh, the Beckmans were another family that would’ve deserved it, too, but I agree, they DID have lots of fun and $41,695 is another impressive total after 4 days."
821,729,1,jpgenius ,I can’t wait for the Maples and Shaws to come back.
822,730,1,jpgenius ,The Maples are BACK!
823,731,1,jpgenius ,HAPPY! HAPPY! HAPPY!
824,731,2,futuresamthegameshow ,"Bobby, Question 3 on Game 1 had the top 8 answers."
825,732,1,jpgenius ,"Happy’s BACK! Oh, and Carson, the Bible study group leader on campus adds to tonight’s hilarity! 😂"
826,733,1,ant0824 ,Brandon Seriously? $1M as Something you’ll NEVER have two of because it was hard enough to get one? Definitely ZONK Answer of the Week?
827,733,2,jpgenius ,Doggone it. A 3-point loss. 🤦🏾‍♂️
828,733,3,ant0824 ,"If only Brandon had said anything other $1M,"
829,734,1,jpgenius ,ANOTHER 3-point loss (from the Minks)? Man! 😳 At least the Minks are going for a car tomorrow.
830,735,1,Matthew Yothers ,"This was a perfect day on Family Feud.
The Mink wins a brand new Jeep Cherokee, and is, so far, our biggest winners this season with $42,530. And also, Karla from the Daly family sets up a new record for the highest 1st player total in the Steve Harvey era with every single #1 answer and 198 points, resulting in another $20,000 win today."
831,735,2,jpgenius ,"You said it Matthew – the Minks’ car win, Karla’s stellar performance, both the Minks and Dalys winning $20K…wow. 👍🏾👍🏾"
832,736,1,jpgenius ,"Fun episodes, but sad to see the Dalys go. Hey, they still did a good job (especially Karla)."
833,736,2,ant0824 ,Especially the One with Ashlynn and Her Sisters did well
834,736,3,ant0824 ,"If you haven’t seen Ashlynn, You may find her on instagram and Youtube by tying in MsAshlynn2"
835,737,1,jpgenius ,"Boy, we’ve had some heartbreaking losses in FM this week, all of them by 3 points. 💔"
836,737,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Also, in the first game, I think Joel thought Steve said _____ detective."
837,738,1,jpgenius ,"Great comeback, Michael!"
838,738,2,Matthew Yothers ,"I agree that Michael’s comeback was amazing, and not to worry, the Echebelems did win the 20K the next day."
839,738,3,Matthew Yothers ,"Or should I say, they WILL get it next time."
840,739,1,jpgenius ,"Nice work, Echebelems!"
841,739,2,genius2751 ,"BTW, Steve called the Scialdone family “the other family” during their steal attempt in the last survey round. 😂"
842,740,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Wait, did the Sabella family come back to the feud again?"
843,740,2,Mitchell Hodack ,Yes!
844,740,3,jpgenius ,Seems like the third time’s the charm for both the Echebelems and Sabellas.
845,740,4,Mitchell Hodack ,$5 a point for a total of $840.
846,740,5,Mitchell Hodack ,The Sabella family has returned!
847,741,1,jpgenius ,Tonight’s FM rounds were UNBELIEVABLE. 😳
848,741,2,Mitchell Hodack ,200 points!
849,741,3,Matthew Yothers ,"WOW, $20,000 right on the nose. WTG Sabellas. I was hoping you would do it."
850,741,4,Mitchell Hodack ,The Sabella family are coming back tomorrow to play for the car!
851,741,5,Rohan Johnson ,"Yup, and I’m sad to see the Echebelems go. they won $20.000 though, and too bad we couldn’t get a doubleheader ☹"
852,742,1,jpgenius ,Sucks to see the Sabellas lose the car. I was really pulling for them. 😥
853,742,2,Rohan Johnson ,"Yeah, and the Walker family didn’t even win $20k."
854,742,3,Matthew Yothers ,"I disagree with the #1 answer of tail for the question “Something a real mouse has that a computer mouse DOESN’T”, because some computer mice have a cord attached to them. Doesn’t that resemble a tail?"
855,743,1,jpgenius ,"Boy, the Ricketsons have gotten HOT! For 40,910 reasons! 🔥 👍🏾👍🏾"
856,744,1,jpgenius ,Nice job Wayne! 👍🏾👍🏾 BTW he originally said “sizzle” and they did a check so he could change his answer because he may have heard “fizzle”.
857,745,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Darn, the Ricketsons were so close to winning that Jeep Cherokee, and they would’ve deserved it, too. But, hey, $41,860 is a very impressive total."
858,745,2,jpgenius ,I can’t wait to see the McHenrys and Carotenutos in April.
859,745,3,jpgenius ,"And worse, exactly 11 years ago, the Boxes lost their 5th game to an upset. WOW. 😳"
860,745,4,Matthew Yothers ,"How much money did the Boxes leave with, though?"
861,745,5,jpgenius ,"$22,030, which isn’t bad."
862,746,1,jpgenius ,"HILARIOUS start to the spring episodes. 😂😂😂 Sad to see the Holmes miss by 6, but glad to see the McHenrys win the money."
863,746,2,jpgenius ,"Wait, Pasquale actually say children?"
864,746,3,jpgenius ,EDIT: Did Pasquale actually say children?
865,747,1,jpgenius ,"HILARIOUS set of families, especially the Glazers! 😂😂😂"
866,748,1,jpgenius ,Wow. Funny episodes tarnished by PAINFUL FM losses. 😥
867,748,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Yeah, and in the Holmes family’s loss, Kevin said “I can’t be here no more. I can’t even be here no more.”"
868,748,3,jpgenius ,Dang. I thought he said “I can’t believe it.”
869,749,1,jpgenius ,ANOTHER painful FM loss by the Holmes?! Man! 😥 I sure hope they win that car on Monday. 🤞🏾🚗
870,749,2,jpgenius ,tack*
871,750,1,jpgenius ,"First off, I’m sad to see the Glazers go. They were so much fun. But I’m glad to see the Satterwhites win $20K! 👍🏾👍🏾"
872,750,2,Rohan Johnson ,And what is even more painful is that the Walterses miss by 20 points.
873,750,3,Nick Brundidge ,"The Holmes may not have won the car however the Satterwhites won $20,000"
874,750,4,Rohan Johnson ,Thank Goodness the Satterwhites won $20.000! 😃
875,751,1,jpgenius ,"Crazy humor tonight, particularly from the Billups and Satterwhites."
876,752,1,Matthew Yothers ,I thought sandwich was going to be #1 for the kid’s lunchbox question.
877,752,2,jpgenius ,The Satterwhites are doing pretty well. I can’t WAIT to see them (especially Robert) and the Westers tomorrow. 😂 (I don’t think I’ve even seen the Westers until now.)
878,752,3,Matthew Yothers ,"When Steve has that accent, it can make it a little bit hard to understand some of the things he said."
879,753,1,jpgenius ,"More hilarity, particularly from the Westers and Rackhams. 😂"
880,754,1,jpgenius ,"Well, this is just getting sad. Another car loss in SD. Sorry Satterwhites. 😥"
881,755,1,Matthew Yothers ,"YES! The Westers won the 🚗 and they finally put $20,000 in the trunk."
882,755,2,jpgenius ,Way to go Westers! 👍🏾👍🏾
883,755,3,Benjamin Mason ,"If memory serves me right, the Westers are the first family since the Reyes’ (remember them from Steve’s first season?) to win $20,000 on their last appearance after four failed attempts. Way to go!"
884,755,4,jpgenius ,"Well, technically 3 attempts (since they lost their first game to the Gants way back in September 2015)."
885,756,1,jpgenius ,FUNNY episodes. 😂😂😂
886,757,1,jpgenius ,These episodes were TOO MUCH!!! 😂😂😂

894,760,3,jpgenius ,Wait wait wait…you should never tell your boss she’s…and I’m looking at the two-letter H-word that two people said. WOW. 😳

897,763,1,jpgenius ,"Patrice’s “solar eclipse eyes”, men working harder than women, and Steve at Chippendales? Crazy moments on these 2 episodes! 😳😂"
898,764,1,jpgenius ,YES! The Watsons are BACK! 👍🏾👍🏾
899,765,1,jpgenius ,"Boy, the Parkers have gotten HOT! But I’m sorry to see the Watsons go."
900,766,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Wow, the Parkers are on a roll. If they win the next game, not only will they win a brand new 🚗, but they will also end this very long streak without a 🚗 victory in Group 2. Go Parkers!"
901,766,2,jpgenius ,"One more, Parkers, one more…"
902,767,1,futuresamthegameshow ,"They won $20,000. Great episode. I only watched the first episode.

Rating: 7"
907,769,2,jpgenius ,"The second episode was HILARIOUS, but it’s nice to see a $20K win at the end. Too bad the Crawfords missed by 4, however."

909,770,2,futuresamthegameshow ,Rating: 5
910,770,3,jpgenius ,Close FM for the Owings. But I hope all our families had fun tonight.

We will see Steve Harvey next season in September!"
914,772,2,jpgenius ,"Great FM win by the Gaines, but PAINFUL loss by the Campbells to close out the season. (Worse, Robinetta said “brush” right after “roller”. WOW.) 🤦🏾"
915,772,3,Matthew Yothers ,"Yeah, I can’t wait to see those 2 families battle it out again next season, and also I hope the Campbell family will finally win the $20K next time."
916,772,4,futuresamthegameshow ,Less than 20 days til the new season. That painful loss…196 points.
917,772,5,futuresamthegameshow ,Ready for the Season Premiere of Family Feud tomorrow?
918,773,1,jpgenius ,This was so much FUN to watch! 😂😁
919,773,2,futuresamthegameshow ,Great episode. There should be 2 games next week.
920,774,1,ant0824 ,"Jennings didn’t win the $25K, but still gets $10K for his Charity. NBA Beaten my favorite MLB.  Love the Celebrity Family Feud"
921,774,2,jpgenius ,"I think that’s the lowest FM score I’ve seen on the Celebrity Feud (150 points, game 2). But the first game was ESPECIALLY funny! 😂😂😂"
922,775,1,jpgenius ,AWESOME job Ayesha! 👍🏾👍🏾💙💛 And great comeback by the Hernandez family.
923,775,2,futuresamthegameshow ,The next new episode airs next weekend.
924,776,1,jpgenius ,Another great set of episodes.
925,776,2,Matthew Yothers ,"For the water running question, if going to the bathroom was #1, I think #2 is going to be bathing or taking a shower."
926,777,1,jpgenius ,Sherri Shepherd and her family left me in STITCHES. 😂
927,778,1,jpgenius ,"Goodness gracious, MORE hilarity. 😂😂😂"
928,779,1,jpgenius ,GREAT comeback by Ayana! 👍🏾👍🏾
929,780,1,jpgenius ,A match between NFL players and another between comic actors makes for good quality TV. But those two censored answers… 😳😂
930,781,1,jpgenius ,Interesting that we had two rappers with Ice in their names win separate matches. 😏
931,782,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Wow, the Gaines family is doing really well in Fast Money so far, already winning $40,000 in 2 days."
932,782,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, I think Chris actually said tongue and rain for the last two questions in that game."
933,782,3,jpgenius ,"Great start to season 20, with both the Gaines and Friends winning $20K! 👍🏾👍🏾"
934,783,1,jpgenius ,"Keep building up that bank, Gaines and Friends."
935,784,1,jpgenius ,"The first episode was HILARIOUS. 😂😂😂 And one more, Gaines, one more…and that car is YOURS! 🚗"
936,784,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Yeah, and for the last question, “a game played on a court,” Michael said baseball, which was a goose egg. Man, they were so close to winning again."
937,785,1,futuresamthegameshow ,"YES!!!! GO GRAB THAT CAR!!!!!!!!! And our second $60,000 winner!
And boy, the Friend family is winning big!!"
938,785,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, the Gaineses have just set a new record in the Steve Harvey era with a total of $61,525. Well done, Gaineses! Plus, I’d really like to see the Friend family win the car, too, so they can end that really long streak without a car win in Group 2."
939,785,3,jpgenius ,"Geez, all this winning makes me wanna jump up and down!"
940,786,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Yes! The Friend family ends this long streak without a car win in Group 2, and will drive out of here in a brand new Toyota C-HR, but they were so close to winning another $20,000 by 7 points, on the other hand, they’re still leaving with $42,560, which is certainly better than nothing. Well done, Friend family!"
941,786,2,jpgenius ,"GREAT job winning the car, Friend Family! Sad that you missed out on the record by 7 points, but $42,560 and a car are nothing to sneeze at! 💵🎉🚗"
942,787,1,jpgenius ,Hilarious set of celebrity episodes. As always. 😂😂😂
943,788,1,jpgenius ,Hilarious. 😂😂😂
944,789,1,jpgenius ,"I’m glad the Herrings and Crosbys won Fast Money! BTW, Dustin and Jessica were on Wheel a few years ago (Sandals Resorts 2014, remember?)."
945,790,1,jpgenius ,"Aw, man! I wanted the Herrings to win the car so bad. 😥🚗 At least I had fun with them."
946,791,1,jpgenius ,GO JENNY!!! 👍🏾👍🏾
947,791,2,colin roley ,yeah I Know its disappointing to see the Crosbys leave because I was hoping for the Crosbys go for the car and it Didn’t
948,792,1,jpgenius ,The Loes have gotten HOT! 🔥
949,793,1,jpgenius ,"Nice to see the Kardashian match again, but this episode was a great season finale! Until next summer…"
950,793,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, you should’ve added hair for the #1 in the last question."
951,794,1,jpgenius ,"Nothing too special about these episodes (sans the $20K win by the Kellys), but I LOVED the question about your favorite song on the radio."
952,795,1,jpgenius ,"One more, Loes, one more…"
953,796,1,mcclellandryan184 ,When will the recap for tonight’s WOF and Jeopardy get posted?
954,796,2,Matthew Yothers ,"No offense, but you made a mistake for the Unsaid #1s in the second game, Derrick DID say stove/oven for Question 4. And also, thank you Labora for saying the correct answer for the states starting with “New” question."
955,796,3,jpgenius ,I think the question should’ve been “how many states can you think of (at the top of your head) that start with New?”
956,796,4,jpgenius ,GO LOES!!! 🎉🚗💵 They’re only the third all-female team to win the car (after the Grays and Finches). They KILLED IT!
957,797,1,jpgenius ,"The first game was CRAZY, mostly thanks to the Longs. The second, due to the Merrietts."
958,798,1,jpgenius ,"Shucks. We’ll get ‘em next time, Prices. 😔"
959,799,1,jpgenius ,"Great work, Prices! 👍🏾👍🏾😁"
960,800,1,jpgenius ,GO NEWMANS!!! I’m just as excited as you are! 👍🏾👍🏾😁🎉
961,801,1,jpgenius ,"Oh, tough finish in FM. But they’ll be back… 😏"
962,801,2,MONICA DENISE SCOTT ,Thank You So Much For Your Help.
963,802,1,futuresamthegameshow ,"I can’t wait for the Merrietts to play for the car. And hopefully win $60,000+."
964,802,2,jpgenius ,"Sad to see the Newmans go, but the Merrietts sure have gotten HOT! 💵"
965,803,1,DAFEWD00 ,GO MERRIETTS!
966,803,2,jpgenius ,WTG MERRIETTS!!! 👍🏾👍🏾💵🚗🎉
967,804,1,jpgenius ,"Great work, Browns! 👍🏾👍🏾"
968,805,1,jpgenius ,The first question in the first game was SO gross. On so many levels. 😳🤢🤦🏾‍♂️
969,806,1,jpgenius ,WHOA! The DeAngelis family have gotten HOT! And I’m happy for the McFarlands winning $20K. 😁
970,807,1,jpgenius ,"Interesting to see two NY vs. LA matches. A shame the Berrys didn’t quite make it to $20K, but the Murphys were HILARIOUS. 😂"
971,807,2,jpgenius ,Wait a minute: the Murphy family looks awfully familiar…
972,807,3,Matthew Yothers ,"I actually saw their first Richard Karn episode before this one, and I do know they got $20,000 in that game, but how much money did they finish with overall?"
973,807,4,jpgenius ,Just $20K.
974,807,5,Matthew Yothers ,"So I guess that means their 2-day total would’ve been $20,420."
975,807,6,Matthew Yothers ,"And I think they probably should’ve stuck with the same Fast Money strategy they did when they won earlier (with Cookie going first and Kaino in the booth), the switcheroo ending up costing them, and they really failed to double their total."
976,807,7,futuresamthegameshow ,Cookie? I’ve never seen that name before.
977,808,1,jpgenius ,Ooh…close FM for the Hlases. 😞
978,808,2,jpgenius ,Wait…Andy Nguyen (the recapper) should take note of the second episode.
979,809,1,jpgenius ,DONALD TRUMP as Steve Harvey?! NO… 😳
980,809,2,Matthew Yothers ,"If Rodney would’ve understood the “______ it off” question a lot better, or if Nickita would’ve said Republican for that 4th question, they would’ve been $20,000 richer."
981,809,3,Matthew Yothers ,"If Rodney would’ve understood the “______ it off” question a lot better, or if Nickita would’ve said Republican for that 4th question, they would’ve been $20,000 richer."
982,809,4,Matthew Yothers ,"Sorry for the duplication, there were some issues the first time I posted this."
983,810,1,jpgenius ,The Nguyens are getting HOT now! But the first FM attempt (by the Gossers) was hard to watch. 😥
984,811,1,jpgenius ,"Sad to see the Nguyens go, but glad to see them leave with $40K+. 💵💵"
985,812,1,jpgenius ,"Fun episodes to watch, especially the first. Happy to see our LA families win $20K! 👍🏾👍🏾"
986,813,1,futuresamthegameshow ,Oh my gosh…..that ending.
987,813,2,jpgenius ,These 2 episodes had me in STITCHES. 😂😂😂
988,814,1,jpgenius ,"Awesome job redeeming yourselves, Farahs! And WTG Valladons, repping the Bay!"
989,815,1,jpgenius ,Great work Valladons! And awesome comeback by the Cunninghams on two levels – a return trip and Sudden Death!
990,816,1,jpgenius ,"Hilarious moments on the Feud, including the Steve/Oprah fiasco and the Steve Sandwich. 😂"
991,817,1,jpgenius ,Good thing our winning families didn’t get spooked in FM! 👍🏾👍🏾🎃👻
992,817,2,jpgenius ,Wait…did Shavoy say RUB YOURSELF? And THREE people agreed?! 😳
993,818,1,jpgenius ,The Harris family sure is interesting! 😂😃
994,819,1,jpgenius ,Ooh…close call for the Estevezes in FM.
995,820,1,Jay ,Looks Like the Feud has sponsored Publishers Clearing House for Some of the Greats Week
996,820,2,jpgenius ,"Interesting concept – a Bonus Week/Some of the Greats, as Jay mentioned. And GREAT job Anna! 👍🏾👍🏾🎉💵"
997,821,1,jpgenius ,"Aw, it’s OK Sasses and Damrons. We’ll get ‘em tomorrow."
998,822,1,jpgenius ,"Ouch – depressing FM by the Sasses, but the Gants made the most of their rematch."
999,823,1,jpgenius ,"Oh GOSH…the Browns are back. And the Sasses…well, if this were normal play, they would’ve broken the record."
1000,824,1,jpgenius ,"Well, you can’t win ‘em all. The Sasses have come a LONG way since the events of four years ago, and $61,965 pretty much breaks the record IF this were regular gameplay. 👍🏾👍🏾"
1001,824,2,Joey Scafetta ,"But please, don’t be into a dangerous Sudden Death spot."
1002,825,1,futuresamthegameshow ,"First, we see 194 points, now a car loss? I was really rooting for the Gants. I hope they rematch."
1003,825,2,jpgenius ,"It’s bad enough seeing the Daytons lose FM by 6, but it’s worse that the Gants lost the car. At least they won $40K+. 😥"
1004,826,1,jpgenius ,Glad to see the Daytons win tonight’s game. Always thrilling to see Sudden Death.
1005,826,2,jpgenius ,Anyway…did anyone recognize Bayleigh from Big Brother 20?
1006,827,1,jpgenius ,"AWESOME win by the Dinisis! Alongside the Daytons, they’re having a VERY good run. 👍🏾👍🏾"
1007,828,1,jpgenius ,FANTASTIC to see the Deharts return AND win $20K! 🤩 At least the Daytons left with $21K+. They were good players.
1008,828,2,Matthew Yothers ,"I agree, and I think you made another mistake on the Unsaid #1s. When Divon said Kool-Aid for the question “Besides coffee, what might you have a big cup of in the morning,” the judges probably counted that as juice."
1009,829,1,BJ Mason ,"Congrats to the Dinisis on their car win. If I’m not mistaken, this was the third time since Steve started hosting that two cross-town families played in a car episode, and the second with hometown families competing following the McNultys vs. Adamses episode near the end of Season 14, when the show was taped in Atlanta."
1010,829,2,futuresamthegameshow ,"What a great day for game shows today! The Dinisi’s win the car, $100,000 win on Wheel."
1011,829,3,jpgenius ,YAY DINISIS! A car AND another $20K? You rock! 🤩🚙👍🏾👍🏾
1012,830,1,jpgenius ,"Well, Deharts, you had a good run. BUT great comeback by Mo Farunia in FM! 👍🏾👍🏾"
1013,831,1,jpgenius ,The Calloways had me in STITCHES. 😂 And great FM win by the Robinsons!
1014,831,2,jpgenius ,"Aw, wait a minute – the Farunias NEVER controlled a survey (except for Sudden Death on the 19th). Bummer. 😥"
1015,832,1,Joey Scafetta ,I love these girls vs. boys matchups.
1016,832,2,jpgenius ,Guess we’ll see the Keiths and Zhangs in January.
1017,832,3,Joey Scafetta ,I guess so.
1018,833,1,jpgenius ,The second game left me in STITCHES. 😂😂😂
1019,834,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Yes! The Zhang girls finally did it, and with a really big win, too."
1020,834,2,jpgenius ,Looks like the third time’s the charm for the Zhangs! Awesome episodes for my birthday! 🤩
1021,835,1,jpgenius ,Good luck on Monday Zhangs! 🚙
1022,836,1,jpgenius ,"I didn’t get to see the first half due to a TV mishap, but OUCH at the Rileys’ near miss in FM. 😥"
1023,836,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Yeah, and based for that store window question, I found out that if OPEN was worth 40, and CLOSED was also worth 40, and FOR SALE was #1, they must’ve counted both OPEN and CLOSED to be the same thing."
1024,837,1,jpgenius ,Where are the Zhangs?!
1025,837,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Yeah, it’s been over a year since they competed earlier (as of 2020), just like the Woods family missed their return trip 3 years before this one."
1026,837,3,Matthew Yothers ,And this is also the Casal family’s first game on the Feud before they returned due to a mistake two years later.
1027,838,1,jpgenius ,"Keep going, Kleins. And one more win, Rileys… 🚙"
1028,839,1,Joey Scafetta ,"Aw, Man! Too Bad, Rileys. You got skunked on a Car!"
1029,839,2,jpgenius ,"MAN. I SO wanted the Rileys to win the car, but they got shutout…sorry about that. 😥"
1030,840,1,Joey Scafetta ,"One more, Kliens. Please do it tomorrow!"
1031,840,2,jpgenius ,"Man, the Kleins are KILLIN’ IT! I sure hope they win the car tomorrow. 🚙"
1032,840,3,ant0824 ,Kleins can go…all…the….way!
1033,841,1,Joey Scafetta ,"I was desperte for the Kliens to win a car, but we got double-car skunked for the week. Any thoughts, Skips and Antawn?"
1034,841,2,Joey Scafetta ,"Good work, Sedas!"
1035,841,3,jpgenius ,GO CHRISANN! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
1036,842,1,jpgenius ,Painful FM loss by the Millers… 😥
1037,842,2,ant0824 ,You Know coming up 2/15 is the one year anniversary of the infamous answer of what Ashlynn Shepherd said was 69 from the Survey: Name a number that most men exaggerated.
1038,842,3,jpgenius ,It was actually February 16. But I remember that… 😂😂😂
1039,843,1,jpgenius ,Good luck tomorrow Sedas! 🚙
1040,843,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Yes, and also the #1 word that rhymes with “flush” was actually blush."
1041,844,1,Joey Scafetta ,"MAN! I thought that was it, but this is terrible, another Car Loss!?!"
1042,844,2,jpgenius ,Seriously? ANOTHER car loss on a good answer? I feel real bad for the Sedas. 😥
1043,845,1,jpgenius ,Great comeback by the Bravos! And awesome FM win by the Santanas! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
1044,846,1,jpgenius ,Congrats Aleisha! 💕
1045,847,1,jpgenius ,"A good night on the Feud: the Gurchieks and Browns win big, especially the Browns! They made an AWESOME comeback! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾"
1046,848,1,jpgenius ,Yikes…we had some struggles in these two Fast Money rounds.
1047,849,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Wow! Congratulations to the Robinson family for winning $20,000, but darn, the Konchels were so close to winning it as well, 191 points, what a heartbreaker that was, I hope they get it next time, and also, you made another mistake on the unsaid #1s in Group 2; for the question, “Something that tastes better when it’s slathered with butter,” Tori did say bread for that one."
1048,849,2,jpgenius ,"Close call in FM for the Konchels…who put an end to the Browns’ comebacks with one of their own. But great $20K win, Robinsons!"
1049,850,1,jpgenius ,"YIKES – another painful FM loss (and braces was a good answer). Sorry, Marianos. 😥"
1050,850,2,jpgenius ,Wait – Cindy Crawford was up there?! I’m done. 🤦🏾‍♂️
1051,851,1,ant0824 ,"This also marks the one year anniversary of the Shepherds Competing on Family (Ashlynn, Bailey, Amber, Brandy, John)"
1052,851,2,jpgenius ,GO CHAR! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
1053,852,1,Joey Scafetta ,Welcome Back Barbers!
1054,852,2,jpgenius ,It’s like the Barbers never left.
1055,853,1,jpgenius ,Good luck tomorrow Barbers! 🚙
1056,854,1,jpgenius ,"Welcome back, Hagemanns."
1057,854,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Yeah, I agree, but they still have $40,855, that’s still good enough to buy a car though."
1058,854,3,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, where’s Derek, he was with the Hagemann family when they first competed on the Feud four years ago, but it looks like Dana replaced him for the rest of their run starting here."
1059,855,1,jpgenius ,"Great job, Dalals and Hagemanns!"
1060,856,1,Joey Scafetta ,"Just One More, Hagemanns, One More, Please do it. We Are Tired of some Car Losses!"
1061,856,2,jpgenius ,I sure hope the Hagemanns break the long streak of car losses on Monday… 🚙😁
1062,857,1,Joey Scafetta ,YES! FINALLY!
1063,857,2,jpgenius ,We ALL feel that way. We finally got a car win this winter.
1064,857,3,jpgenius ,"Thanks a bundle, Hagemanns! 👏🏾🚙💵"
1065,857,4,ant0824 ,Not to Mention that Hagemann’s Also Won Another $20K in their final Attempt in Fast Money + The Car.
1066,857,5,jpgenius ,That’s what happens when you don’t give up hope for a car win. And we got one! 😉
1067,857,6,jpgenius ,"Also, did you notice that the graphics displayed the Hagemann’s final score? If only they did this every episode."
1068,857,7,Matthew Yothers ,"I agree, and also, the Hagemann family came back after 4 years to win a car (just like their opponents, the Grier family) and $41,660. Congratulations Hagemanns!"
1069,857,8,chupon ,I deleted the show on DVR after they won the car and forgot about fast money lol. Thanks for this site.
1070,858,1,jpgenius ,"I enjoyed these two episodes, especially the second one."
1071,859,1,jpgenius ,Can’t wait to see the new champs in April.
1072,859,2,Joey Scafetta ,But what about the Zhangs?
1073,859,3,jpgenius ,"Yeah, what happened to them?!"
1074,859,4,jpgenius ,"No, with them?"
1075,860,1,jpgenius ,The second-run match was very entertaining…up until the painful FM loss. 😔
1076,860,2,jpgenius ,"Oh, and by the way, the Schoecks are from St. Louis."
1077,861,1,jpgenius ,Great FM wins! And the Assads are hilarious. 😂😂😂
1078,862,1,jpgenius ,"Personally, I found this week’s second-run episodes more fun to watch than the first. Anyway, the Burnleys are on a nice little roll…"
1079,863,1,jpgenius ,"Boy, the Burnleys are on FIRE! Good luck on Monday! 🚙"
1080,864,1,Nick Brundidge ,Congratulations to the Burnley family on winning a brand new 🚗
1081,864,2,Jay ,What type of car did they win?
1082,864,3,Jay ,Did they win a car? Is this from the new season?
1083,864,4,jpgenius ,Great job Wesleys…and AWESOME car win by the Burnleys! 🤩👏🏾💵🚙
1084,864,5,jpgenius ,BTW that’s the first car win in the first run since September. Wow.
1085,864,6,Joey Scafetta ,"Now all we need is the Zhang girls to win, right?"
1086,864,7,jpgenius ,"Yeah, where are the Zhangs?!"
1087,864,8,jpgenius ,"You know what, I think there may have been a scheduling conflict. This happened to some champs on the Canadian show named the Browns who won $795 in February."
1088,865,1,jpgenius ,"Ah, the start of the Alofaitulis’ entertaining adventure… 😏"
1089,866,1,jpgenius ,"Go Renee! 👏🏾 And it’s OK, Alofaitulis. We’ll get ‘em next time."
1090,867,1,jpgenius ,WTG Bernalee! I’m so happy for the Alofaitulis! 👏🏾
1091,868,1,jpgenius ,"Great run, Alofaitulis. And welcome back, Schieves! The second-run game left me in STITCHES. 😂"
1092,869,1,jpgenius ,"Welcome back, Woods! And boy, are the Richardsons hilarious. 😂😂😂"
1093,869,2,jpgenius ,"Wait a minute – I’m sorry, but how did “private parts” score ZERO in Fast Money?! 😳🤦🏾‍♂️🤢"
1094,869,3,Matthew Yothers ,"And for the Woods family, why did you say win THIS time? They won their first game back in 2016."
1095,869,4,jpgenius ,"I dunno what happened, but they disappeared after their first game."
1096,870,1,jpgenius ,Close FM for the Auguars. 😥 But they are FUNNY. 😂😂😂
1097,871,1,jpgenius ,"Great job Auguars! And one more, Woods, one more… 🚙"
1098,872,1,jpgenius ,GO WOODS!!! It’s like they never left! 👏🏾🚙
1099,872,2,Matthew Yothers ,"I agree, but they were so close to get another $20,000 again, but still, despite their 1st game being played 3 years ago, they won $23,385 in their run including the car. Well done to them."
1100,873,1,jpgenius ,I had fun watching the Auguars. Can’t wait to see the Dieks and Fergusons next week.
1101,874,1,jpgenius ,"Nice to see a male vs. female match in the first run. And great work, Whitneys!"
1102,875,1,jpgenius ,"Awesome win, Zampieris! And it’s OK, Washingtons, we’ll get ‘em next time."
1103,875,2,gas generators manufacturers ,"Very nice blog post. I certainly appreciate thyis site.
Stick with it!"
1104,875,3,Matthew Yothers ,"Actually, candy and pop are completely different, I found out in a previous game that candy was actually worth 48."
1105,876,1,jpgenius ,"Welcome back, Schmidts! And AWESOME FM, Bridget! 👏🏾"
1106,877,1,jpgenius ,The Zampieris are HOT now! 👏🏾
1107,878,1,Andrew DeCaro ,Very Bad First Day For the Thompson Family only got 107 Points I Give That Epsiode an F
1108,878,2,jpgenius ,"Good luck, Schmidts! 🚙 And while I’m a little sad to see the Zampieris go, I’m happy they won big. The Thompsons, on the other hand, are HILARIOUS. I can’t wait for them to come back. 😂😂😂"
1109,879,1,jpgenius ,"Yay, Thompsons! And GO SCHMIDTS!!! 💵🚙🎉"
1110,879,2,Matthew Yothers ,"I agree jpgenius, and also, that’s two cars in a row. First the Schmidts were denied a car repo by the Woodses, but now, they won the car as well with $41,200 in the trunk. Amazing!"
1111,879,3,NANCY SIMONE ,when were these actually filmed??
1112,879,4,Matthew Yothers ,"IDK, in the past, when it comes to those games, they used to do 5 games a day, but now, I think they’re doing 2 or 4 (usually 4) times a day."
1113,879,5,Matthew Yothers ,I could tell because of each of the family members’ outfits in each game.
1114,880,1,Andrew DeCaro ,"One Week From Tomorrow Will Be The season Finale Of Family Feud Because this is almost the end of Season 20. So You Better Enjoy it While You Can Because After Next Wedensday No More New Eposides until The Show begins season 21 Because it might be Steve Harvey’s Last season as host of the show which will begin On September 9, 2019"
1115,880,2,jpgenius ,"Keep it going, Thompsons. 👏🏾"
1116,881,1,jpgenius ,"Ouch. It’s OK, Townsends, we’ll get ‘em next time."
1117,881,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And speaking of which, when the Thompsons were doing a group hug during their second $20,000 win, Tranette, Ian, and Echele all fell over on the stage. 😂 It’s a good thing they were able to get back up, though."
1118,882,1,jpgenius ,GO THOMPSONS!!! 🚙
1119,883,1,jpgenius ,The Matos’ FM was quite a thrill! And the Fishers are FUNNY. 😂😂😂
1120,884,1,Andrew DeCaro ,Only 2 Days And 4 Shows left because Wedensday Is your last Chance To Watch Family Feud For this season Because the Next new Epsiode will be September 9.
1121,885,1,Andrew DeCaro ,Those 2 Episodes were A Piece of Cake Tune In Tomorrow For the Big Season 20 Finale Of Family Feud Because This will be your last chance to watch New Epsiodes Until the Beginning Of Season 21 Begins on Monday September 9.
1122,885,2,jpgenius ,Great FM wins by the Stoners and Morales! 👏🏾 And I had fun with the Fishers and Hines as well.
1123,885,3,jpgenius ,Wait a sec: did Miggy say pterodactyl?! Did he watch the Cunninghams’ FM? 😂😂😂
1124,886,1,Andrew DeCaro ,Thank You For Watching Family Feud This season. Will See You Back here On Monday September 9. As new Epsoides begin for the 21st Season With Steve Harvey Returning For What All Likely Could Be his 10th and Final Season as Host. And Rubin Irivn Returning For his 5th season as announcer on Family Feud. Have A Great Summer Will See You September 9.
1125,886,2,jpgenius ,"See you in September, Kyles and Morales families. 👍🏾👍🏾"
1126,887,1,jpgenius ,"Funny start to the season! 😂😂😂 And boy, was Terry close in FM."
1127,888,1,jpgenius ,"These two matches were fun, especially the first one. For those who don’t know, 5SOS and the Chainsmokers collaborated on a song called “Who Do You Love”. 🎶"
1128,889,1,jpgenius ,GO MARTHA!!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
1129,889,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Also, Austin Powers and Austin, Texas were tied for the top in the last question."
1130,890,1,jpgenius ,The first episode was WAY too funny. 😂😂😂
1131,891,1,ant0824 ,Those Celebrities on Celebrity Family Feud are really Fun and Enjoyable especially Winning the Fast Money really Made my Day Brighter
1132,891,2,Alan ,"Just for the record, 198 appears to be the current record for Harvey-era Feud, but that was close.
Player One has reached 200+ points by themselves a number of times before (based on a quick YT search, at least four, including twice by the same family and once by a celebrity team), but apparently, not since the Ray Coombs era (add corrections where needed).
Coombs would bring the second player out, tell them they needed 186 points, and start feeding them joke questions before saying ‘go ahead and turn around’ – go watch them on YT, they’re worth a few chuckles (we miss you Ray).  I would love to see Harvey be able to try that one day."
1133,891,3,jpgenius ,GO TODD! 👏🏾 These two episodes were fun.
1134,892,1,jpgenius ,"Nice to see Katy Mixon back on Celebrity Feud. And I hate to say it, but I saw a FM loss coming this season. But lip injections?! 😂"
1135,893,1,jpgenius ,The first game was HILARIOUS. 😂 But I’m surprised we have another FM loss in the second.
1136,894,1,jpgenius ,"Fun matches, and I’m especially glad to see Doug Flutie and Ninja win theirs! 🤩"
1137,895,1,jpgenius ,"Wow, two FM losses on a celebrity episode. That’s a first. 😳"
1138,895,2,ant0824 ,At Least those Celebrities are Fun although Still get $10K for not reaching 200 Points
1139,896,1,Matthew Yothers ,"For the second game, spouse/mate was worth 42 for the high school reunion question, so another season started off with two $20,000 wins."
1140,896,2,jpgenius ,"Great start to the season! But the Sudden Death round in game 2 shocked me. When I hear “potbelly”, I think of someone’s stomach, not pigs."
1141,896,3,Joey Scafetta ,"I think Shawn meant to say Japan, right?"
1142,896,4,jpgenius ,Correct.
1143,897,1,jpgenius ,The champs in both games are on a nice little roll…
1144,897,2,Matthew Yothers ,"In Game 1, Megan was the one who went first, not Cindy."
1145,898,1,jpgenius ,"Go Julia! And welcome back, Haleys!"
1146,898,2,jpgenius ,"Wait a second – for the heaven question, how did #8 make the board?! 😳🤦🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️"
1147,899,1,jpgenius ,The Contes are on FIRE! 🔥 And the Charasikas are hilarious. 😂😂😂
1148,900,1,jpgenius ,"Keep me in stitches, Charasikas. And yay at a car win! WTG Contes! 🚙👏🏾🎉"
1149,901,1,jpgenius ,The Eubanks sure tried to come back.
1150,902,1,jpgenius ,"I had fun with the Charasikas and Hopkins. It’s OK, Cantillons. We’ll get ‘em next time."
1151,903,1,jpgenius ,GO TREY!!! And the Martins are hilarious. 😂😂😂
1152,904,1,jpgenius ,So happy for the Martins winning FM. And it’s sucks that the DeGrews didn’t have a SHOT on Anthony’s birthday. 😥 Happy birthday nonetheless! 🎉🎂
1153,904,2,jpgenius ,"Another thing: for the second game’s third question – had the Zubkes stolen that one, they would’ve won the game. Am I the only one that noticed that?"
1154,905,1,jpgenius ,"The Bautistas are HOT! 🔥 And Andre sure struggled in FM, but Gwen really tried to make a comeback."
1155,906,1,jpgenius ,Great comeback by the Bautistas and second FM win by the Martins! Can’t wait to see both play for a car on Monday. Best of luck! 👏🏾🚙
1156,907,1,jpgenius ,This season finale was a BLAST. 😂
1157,907,2,ant0824 ,With not one but two fast money rounds with the 2 families that competed
1158,907,3,jpgenius ,That’s never happened before! Too bad they didn’t win either of them.
1159,908,1,jpgenius ,"While I’m disappointed the Martins didn’t win the car 😔, I’m excited about the first game! WTG Bautistas! 👏🏾🚙💵"
1160,909,1,jpgenius ,"The first episode left me in stitches. 😂 And good try in FM, Gibsons and Shurlands."
1161,910,1,jpgenius ,"Thrilling FM rounds! Great job, Whites and Shurlands!"
1162,910,2,jpgenius ,"BTW, the Whites’ hometown is actually called Atmore."
1163,911,1,Matthew Yothers ,"I found out for the roadkill cafe question, the 2nd strike was “snake”, not “steak”."
1164,911,2,jpgenius ,I did NOT see the Olszewskis’ comeback coming! WTG! 👏🏾
1165,912,1,jpgenius ,"Great job, Noas!"
1166,912,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Congrats on winning the $20,000 Noas, and by the way, the #1 answer for “something that gets static electricity in it” was clothing."
1167,913,1,jpgenius ,Not much to say about this episode…but the Noas are on a nice little roll.
1168,914,1,jpgenius ,"Good run, Noas. And Aloaf sure tried."
1169,915,1,jpgenius ,"Wait, what?! Lorraine Bracco’s cousins are on the Feud! Awesome! They came awfully close in FM, though."
1170,916,1,jpgenius ,Good work Braccos!
1171,916,2,Lashon Roys ,"@Vijay: Because they’ve been fooled into thinking that. Like Ravi said, many Indians are not great at critical thinking, and only memorization. Coupled with the fact that we’re still a deeply religious culture, most of the population is very easily swayed into believing bullshit.Cow dung IS good manure, sure, and it has other uses too. But cow urine? It’s just poison."
1172,917,1,jpgenius ,"Man, I feel bad for the Stones. Nails was a good answer."
1173,918,1,jpgenius ,Go Vicknairs! And the Huffakers and Lewises are hilarious.
1174,919,1,jpgenius ,Now that’s more like it. WTG Lewises! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
1175,920,1,Alan ,"A 183 solo score…So not quite the dismal day for game shows some people are implying.  With a BD Win, LMAD was decent, too, though still quite a few Zonks today.  ’25 Words’ had a BR win, too.  Pretty sure we’re just feeling the effects of PBMW (Post-Big Money Week)."
1176,920,2,jpgenius ,"The Vicknairs are on FIRE! 🔥 And one more, Lewises, one more… 🚙"
1177,921,1,Joey Scafetta ,"Just one more, Vicknair girls, Please?
Please, Pleasey-Weasy, Please, PLEASE!!!
And Way to Go, Lewis Family! What a time to take home a car!"
1178,921,2,jpgenius ,"Go Lewises! 🚙💵👏🏾 And one more, Vicknairs, one more…"
1179,922,1,Joey Scafetta ,Pool Party in The Big Easy!!
1180,922,2,jpgenius ,"MAN, both FM losses were so agonizing, I dunno which one was worse. But on the flip side, go Vicknairs! Enjoy that car! 🚙💵👏🏾"
1181,922,3,Matthew Yothers ,"Wow, only 2 points for Megan. That was a really disappointing performance at the end."
1182,922,4,Matthew Yothers ,"And after Anne got 153 points, Abby crawled a little too much at the end, but let’s look at the bright side, they’re still leaving with $42,345 and a brand new Jeep Cherokee, that’s another car given away in a row. WTG VICKNAIR GIRLS!"
1183,923,1,jpgenius ,IMHO the last two first-run episodes were pretty bizarre. 😳😬
1184,923,2,Matthew Yothers ,"When Jessica said porcupine for “An animal you should NEVER poke”, that definitely brought Steve back to his favorite funny moment on the Feud."
1185,924,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Oh, darn! The Galaviz family was SO CLOSE to getting $20,000 by 3 points! Better luck next time, guys. But congratulations to the Flowers family for a very easy $20,000 win, and Jessica duplicated ALL of Jennifer’s answers, but she gave a bunch of good answers as well."
1186,924,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Also, for the question, “a bird that you cook”, Jessica said “goose” not “ewe” (which would’ve been a zero anyway)."
1187,924,3,Matthew Yothers ,"Also, for the question “a bird that you cook”, Jessica said “goose” not “ewe” (which would’ve been a zero anyway)."
1188,924,4,jpgenius ,Oh so close for the Galaviz family…but great job by the Flowers! (I’m shocked Jessica repeated all of Jennifer’s answers in that round.)
1189,925,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Oh, darn! The Galaviz family was SO CLOSE to getting $20,000; just missed out by 3 points. You’ll get it next time, guys!"
1190,925,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Oops, wrong game! Sorry about that!"
1191,925,3,jpgenius ,"Keep it going, Flowers…and nice work in FM, Harrys! I was rooting for the opposing teams, though."
1192,926,1,jpgenius ,"One more, Flowers… 🚙"
1193,927,1,jpgenius ,Go Flowers! The left side is getting lucky! 🚙💵🎊
1194,927,2,Matthew Yothers ,"For the slot machine jackpot question, I think the people who said $1,000 are definitely lying, and besides, I think $1,000 is nothing for a slot machine jackpot. Who the heck did they survey for that one?"
1195,928,1,jpgenius ,I sure had fun with the Browns. And I can’t wait to see the Trans and Matkins again next week (unless it’s Bonus Week again). They were fun to watch.
1196,929,1,jpgenius ,Go Randa! 👏🏾 And nice to see that Bonus Week is back. 🤩
1197,930,1,Matthew Yothers ,"WOW! 4 games already because of Sudden Death, I’d really like to see the Matkins make it 3 cars in a row for Group 2! GO MATKINS!"
1198,930,2,jpgenius ,"One more, Matkins. One more… 🚙 And the Harrises are on a nice little roll."
1199,931,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Wow, that’s 3 cars in a row! Too bad the Matkins couldn’t get another $20,000 in the trunk, but they’re still leaving with $22,175 and a brand new car. WTG MATKINS!"
1200,931,2,Joey Scafetta ,"(Extreme Mordecai Voice) OHHHHHHH, 3 IN A ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!"
1201,931,3,Charles Shen ,Total of 6 car winning families so far this season.  Only 4 last season cause Toyota C-HR is too small.
1202,931,4,jpgenius ,"No, there were 10 last season."
1203,931,5,jpgenius ,SO happy for the Matkins! And that’s the first time I’ve seen 3 car wins in a row. 👏🏾🚙🎊
1204,931,6,Matthew Yothers ,"Amazing, first, the Grier family vs the Hagemann family, then the Wester family vs the Gant family, then the Schmidt family vs the Woods family, and NOW the Flowers family vs the Matkin family. That’s 4 times so far that we’ve had 2 car winners against each other."
1205,932,1,Matthew Yothers ,"YES, the Crum family has won $30,000, and they get to conclude the week. But darn, the Mossers were so close to winning $20,000 by only 21 points, better luck next time, guys."
1206,932,2,jpgenius ,Yay Crums!
1207,933,1,jpgenius ,"Bravo, Bravos! (See what I did there?) And Mossers! The Crums sure won big, though."
1208,933,2,Joey Scafetta ,"Yeah, I know."
1209,934,1,jpgenius ,"Funny FM by the Trans. 😂 And keep it going, Mossers."
1210,935,1,Matthew Yothers ,"WTG Mossers, especially Robin, I hope you guys make it 4 cars in a row for Group 2!"
1211,935,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Also, I’m so glad Cameron got 10 lbs. for the first question, otherwise he would’ve been in trouble."
1212,935,3,jpgenius ,GO ROBYN!!! And the Trans are on a nice roll! 👏🏾
1213,936,1,Matthew Yothers ,"WOW! The Mossers have put up a record-breaking 4 cars in a row! Brutal attempt in Fast Money by both Robin and Cameron, but they’re still leaving with $41,885 and a brand new Jeep Cherokee. Congrats, guys!"
1214,936,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, Robin thought Steve said F for the second question, so they gave her more time on the last one."
1215,936,3,jpgenius ,Four car wins in a row?! GO MOSSERS!!! 👏🏾🎉🚙
1216,936,4,jpgenius ,"Bummed to see the Trans’ run come to an end, but even sadder to see a heartbreaking FM loss afterwards."
1217,936,5,Matthew Yothers ,"Yeah, and the odds were really in their favor, too."
1218,936,6,jpgenius ,Whose favor?
1219,936,7,Matthew Yothers ,"The Bussey family, I thought they were gonna get it, but they crawled a little too much once again."
1220,937,1,jpgenius ,So happy for the Busseys and Heyds. Aloha! 😁
1221,937,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Yes, the Busseys now got $20,000, that certainly made up for that disappointing/heartbreaking loss last time."
1222,938,1,jpgenius ,"I just realized I haven’t commented on these two episodes yet. It’s nice to see the Stallworths win $20K, and for the last question in the second episode, Kiara wanted to say tic-tac-toe instead of checkers. Boy, was Terry LUCKY that was the winning answer."
1223,938,2,Matthew Yothers ,"In the Haywood family’s first game (2nd Group game here) another “more specific” incident happened, for the question “something you plug in”, Louise said electrical cords and the judges told her to be more specific there, and that was when she said lamp for that one."
1224,939,1,jpgenius ,"Not much to say about these episodes, but the Stallworths and Haywoods are hilarious. 😂"
1225,940,1,jpgenius ,"Go Kiara! And one more, Stallworths, one more…"
1226,941,1,jpgenius ,Poor Stallworths. 😭
1227,942,1,Alan ,"Okay, so a car *was* given away today.  Tied with Viera."
1228,942,2,jpgenius ,Go Haywoods! 🚙👏🏾 And I can’t wait to see the Swaynes again. They are funny. 😂
1229,942,3,Joey Scafetta ,"5, Count ’em, 5 cars in a row!"
1230,942,4,jpgenius ,"Personally, I’m not sure if it’s 5 in a row given the Haywoods weren’t one of the new families."
1231,942,5,Matthew Yothers ,"Yeah, I would say ALMOST 5 in a row, ’cause the Haywoods beat another family that was one of two brand new teams."
1232,942,6,Matthew Yothers ,"Actually, it got 6 points."
1233,943,1,jpgenius ,"I can’t wait to see the Swaynes and Jacobs next week, especially the Swaynes. They are FUN, and I’m so happy to see them win $20K."
1234,944,1,Matthew Yothers ,What’s going on about those really big #1’s (60+) not being given? I thought those were really obvious.
1235,944,2,jpgenius ,"Nice work, Jacobs!"
1236,945,1,jpgenius ,"It’s OK, Jacobs. We’ll get ‘em next time. And great job, Lees!"
1237,946,1,Matthew Yothers ,"We’re all gonna be on the edge of our seats right now! The Jacobs family has to wait until January to play for the car, that would be the 9th possible car giveaway this season, and almost the 6th one in a row for Group 2."
1238,946,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Also, well done on getting another $20,000, Jacobs family! CUE THE GRAPHICS ONCE AGAIN!"
1239,946,3,jpgenius ,"Go Jacobs! Let’s nab that car in January, shall we? 💵🚙 I can’t wait to see them and the Picazos in my birthday month."
1240,946,4,Matthew Yothers ,"Wait, your birthday is in January? Wow! What day is that?"
1241,946,5,jpgenius ,The 22nd.
1242,947,1,jpgenius ,Go Jacobs! 🚙💵 And I can’t wait to see the Allens tomorrow. They are FUNNY. 😂
1243,947,2,Matthew Yothers ,"OMG, way to go Jacobs family, that’s almost 6 cars in a row for Group 2, this new record just keeps going right now."
1244,947,3,Matthew Yothers ,"Too bad they really couldn’t get another $20,000 today, I guess they should’ve stuck with the same team they kept using earlier, but $41,765 is a very good 5-day stay, WTG Jacobs family, go get that car!"
1245,947,4,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, the Mai family lost to not one, but TWO car winners in their run earlier (the Haywoods on November 19th, and the Jacobses on November 22nd)."
1246,948,1,jpgenius ,"Welcome back, Scotts! And boy, was the first episode FUNNY or what? 😂😂😂"
1247,949,1,Joey Scafetta ,OUCH! That hurts for the Allens! (That happened to the Zerbys in 2005)
1248,949,2,jpgenius ,"Those FM losses had to hurt, especially the first one. 😳"
1249,949,3,jpgenius ,And on my birthday! 🤦🏾‍♂️
1250,949,4,ant0824 ,And That Unfortunately is the Worst of the Entire Season.  
1251,949,5,ant0824 ,Hope Skipps is watching this one.
1252,950,1,jpgenius ,"Nice job, Tsetsos! The Allens had a good run."
1253,950,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Also, Angela actually said cook for the first Fast Money question which was still 45 points, but clean/housework was still the #1 answer, although they didn’t really need it, since they already won the money."
1254,951,1,jpgenius ,Go Amy! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
1255,952,1,jpgenius ,"Ah, the start of the Winchesters’ adventure."
1256,953,1,Alan ,"…Good first half, anyway."
1257,953,2,jpgenius ,WTG Kim! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Wait…did Chris just twerk during the FM celebration?!
1258,954,1,jpgenius ,"Now we’re talking, Winchesters."
1259,955,1,jpgenius ,"Nice job, Paytons! And boy, I can’t wait to see the Winchesters go for a car on Monday. They have been a blast to watch so far. 🚗"
1260,956,1,jpgenius ,"Tough luck for the Winchesters. No WAY they would’ve gotten that last answer. 😥 They made me laugh, though."
1261,956,2,Rohan Johnson ,"Yeah, That last answer was a tough one. I heard Aaleyah in the back helping Valerie out with the gym and hotel answer and both of those answers were not up there. I wouldn’t have thought of Proctologist, and that’s a stupid answer."
1262,957,1,jpgenius ,"Nice FM wins, even though the second was funnier."
1263,958,1,Frank ,"On February 5, 2020 the answer to one of the questions was Fanny Pack.  The contestant said Family Pack and she got it right.  I think the judges made a mistake."
1264,958,2,jpgenius ,The Oberholtzers have gotten HOT! 🔥
1265,959,1,jpgenius ,"The Sanchezs are on FIRE! 🔥 One more, guys. One more… 🚙"
1266,959,2,MONICA DENISE SCOTT ,Great Job Steve Harvey With Your Game Family Feud OK. Steve Harvey You Can Talk Without Cussing All Of The Time. Steve Harvey Keep Up The Good Work With Your Game Show Family Feud OK. Your Greatest Fan MONICA D.SCOTT
1267,960,1,jpgenius ,"MAN, two car losses in a row?! I feel awful for the Sanchez family. 😭"
1268,960,2,Rohan Johnson ,"Yeah, I feel the same way, but hey, let’s look on the bright side. they still have $41,570, and that’s actually good enough to buy a car."
1269,961,1,Matthew Yothers ,"In Game 1, which Dan went 2nd in Fast Money, Jr. or Sr.?"
1270,961,2,jpgenius ,Dan Jr. I think Dan Jr.’s actually their son-in-law.
1271,961,3,jpgenius ,"Not much to say, except the second game was fun to watch."
1272,962,1,jpgenius ,"Yay Witkowskis! And boy, George sure tried in FM."
1273,962,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Yeah, he certainly took a shot here, and the Witkowskis finally got the right group for Fast Money. Pam did really well and got 167 points, and despite starting with two zeroes, Sarah brought it home and got the win right on the nose."
1274,962,3,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, that long car trip question was certainly a tough question, I don’t know what other snacks people would think of for that one."
1275,963,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Not to be rude, but in the first question of the 2nd Fast Money, shouldn’t you have capitalized the H in he since the question was talking about God?"
1276,963,2,Matthew Yothers ,And capitalize the H in his as well for the same reason.
1277,963,3,jpgenius ,"Welcome back, Campbells and Deckers! As for the latter family…great job, Luke!"
1278,964,1,jpgenius ,Great comeback by the Whites in the second game.
1279,965,1,jpgenius ,OH so close call for the Skocys…but great job in FM by the Whites!
1280,965,2,Matthew Yothers ,When are you going to release yesterday’s games of Family Feud (2/17/2020)?
1281,965,3,Matthew Yothers ,"Sorry, I just realized today’s game (2/18/2020) has just been released so I’ll put my comment there."
1282,965,4,Matthew Yothers ,Is it okay if I do that?
1283,966,1,Matthew Yothers ,When are you going to release yesterday’s games of Family Feud (2/17/2020)?
1284,966,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And also I know the Keyes family got $20,000, but what is the White family’s 3-day total from yesterday?"
1285,966,3,jpgenius ,"The White family’s total was $21,325."
1286,966,4,Joey Scafetta ,"Maybe you should try February 29, 2020."
1287,966,5,jpgenius ,"Great run, Whites."
1288,967,1,jpgenius ,Go Jeremy! 👏🏾 But OH so close for the Shahs. 😳
1289,968,1,Colin Roley ,GO DARCIA!!!!!!

1292,969,1,Colin Roley ,Good Luck Tirres and take home a brand new car
1293,969,2,jpgenius ,"Jeremy’s been doing his JOB! Good luck on Monday, Tirres! 🚙"
1294,969,3,Matthew Yothers ,"In the question “something you buy by the yard”, I think material in this case is another way to say fabric/cloth, because that’s what Steve said was #1 for that one."
1295,970,1,jpgenius ,"Great work, Blancos! I had a gut feeling the first game would go to Sudden Death."
1296,970,2,Andrew e. KIM ,oh no thats sad 😦 tirres family
1297,970,3,Matthew Yothers ,"Yeah, I agree, but let’s look at the bright side, they still have $41,470, that’s still good enough to actually buy a car though."
1298,970,4,Matthew Yothers ,"But man, we just can’t give this thing away too often in this part of each season since 2017.
2017: 4 cars
2018: 1 car
2019: 1 car (last minute)
2020: 1 car (immediately)"
1299,971,1,jpgenius ,"I like the Bobeks, but I hate to see the DeCous go."
1300,971,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Yeah, but congrats on winning the $20,000, Bobeks! And good luck in the final winter game of the season!"
1301,971,3,Matthew Yothers ,"And I believe for the 4th question, Steve said “In your opinion, what’s the safest way to travel?”"
1302,972,1,Joey Scafetta ,I can’t wait to see more of the Reugers and Bobeks in April!
1303,972,2,jpgenius ,Ouch at the second FM. And I second Joey’s comment. 👍🏾
1304,972,3,Matthew Yothers ,"Yeah, and I would’ve loved to see another doubler happen on the Feud after a while, and I believe it was a year ago since we last had a doubler in Fast Money."
1305,972,4,Matthew Yothers ,"I know I asked that last time with the Witkowskis, but which Kyle went 2nd in this Fast Money, Sr. or Jr.?"
1306,973,1,jpgenius ,The Bobeks are on a ROLL! 🔥 And great work by the Rueger twins (Kali and Corinne) in FM. 👏🏾
1307,974,1,jpgenius ,"One more, Bobeks, one more… 🚗"
1308,975,1,Joey Scafetta ,The first game was Meachem vs. Henderson
1309,975,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And the Hendersons consisted of Jess, Tim, Chloe, Caiti, & Terry."
1310,975,3,jpgenius ,Did you catch where they were from?
1311,975,4,Matthew Yothers ,"No, I don’t know where they’re from."
1312,975,5,jpgenius ,"FINALLY! A car win! Go, Bobeks! 🚙👏🏾 And for those who were wondering…"
1313,975,6,Joey Scafetta ,*see
1314,975,7,Cody Natof ,What was the first query? And what were the answers?
1315,976,1,Matthew Yothers ,"In our 2nd group game, the Abundis family is returning for their 2nd day with $20,000."
1316,976,2,Joey Scafetta ,Where’s Group A?
1317,976,3,Joey Scafetta ,Where’s the first game and what are the answers?
1318,976,4,jpgenius ,You might wanna check the Feud’s Facebook/YouTube pages and Game Show NewsNet for that (as well as Monday’s recap).
1319,976,5,jpgenius ,"Keep it going, Abundis family…"
1320,977,1,jpgenius ,"Sad to see the Abundis family go, because they won a whole lot for 3 games. As for the Johnsons, I’m glad they won, since Kristy’s story is truly inspiring."
1321,977,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And on April 22, I know the Abundis family competed against the Brown family, but what are the names of the members of that family? I can only make out Todd as the captain, and Makenna as the third member, but I don’t know everyone else."
1322,977,3,Matthew Yothers ,Never mind.
1323,978,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Today is actually day 3 for the Qurashi family, and they are returning with $20,555."
1324,978,2,jpgenius ,"The Mayfields were on the Feud back in May 2017, making this their second game. And boy, did they make their return trip count with their comeback!"
1325,979,1,jpgenius ,"Keep it going, Steins."
1326,980,1,jpgenius ,Sad to see the Mayfields and Steins go. They were a whole lotta fun. But great $20K win by the Joneses! 👏🏾
1327,981,1,jpgenius ,Poor Holders. They were awfully close in FM. But the Abundises had a great start to their run!
1328,982,1,jpgenius ,"If only they got some more good answers in FM, the Bustos’ comeback would’ve been complete. But they’ll be back."
1329,983,1,jpgenius ,"Yay Bustos! As Steve said, third time’s the charm! 👏🏾"
1330,984,1,jpgenius ,"The Whites stole for the win again?! They’re on a roll! (As we all know, that would end the next game.)"
1331,985,1,jpgenius ,"Oh…they’re switching to the second run. Well, I can’t wait for the Rodríguezes to come back. They’re FUNNY. 😂"
1332,986,1,jpgenius ,INCREDIBLE comeback in FM! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
1333,987,1,jpgenius ,"Welcome back, Opals! I sure wish they won $20K, though; they came close in FM. And the Bustos had a pretty good run."
1334,988,1,jpgenius ,This is confusing. Why is this the Opal’s 4th game?! Is tomorrow’s finale their 3rd?
1335,989,1,jpgenius ,WHOO! Go Opals! That’s how you close out the season! 👏🏾🚙💵
1336,989,2,ant0824 ,How much did the opals won during their run?
1337,989,3,jpgenius ,"$21,835. For THREE wins."
1338,990,1,jpgenius ,What a FUN start to this year’s Celebrity Feud.
1339,990,2,Matthew Yothers ,"$25,000 for charity already, and also, Carson Kressley is back once again."
1340,991,1,jpgenius ,I found the first game WAY funnier than the second. 😂😂😂
1341,992,1,Matthew Yothers ,I heard Stephen say sugar after a couple of duplications on that last question.
1342,992,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, congratulations to “The Bold Type” for winning the $25,000 for Girls, Inc."
1343,992,3,jpgenius ,This might just beat Queer Eye as the funniest match this season so far. 😂
1344,992,4,jpgenius ,And this is Carson’s THIRD time on Celebrity Feud (and second this season). What’s up with that?!
1345,993,1,jpgenius ,"These episodes were fun to watch, esp. the second one."
1346,994,1,jpgenius ,That FM was the FUNNIEST I’ve seen on Celebrity Feud this season. 😂😂😂
1347,995,1,jpgenius ,"Nice, Celebrity Feud is back. But I’m stunned Patrick blanked on a month in FM."
1348,996,1,jpgenius ,These two episodes were hilarious.
1349,996,2,ant0824 ,Celebrity Family Feud is Even More Fun when Celebrities Played
1350,997,1,jpgenius ,"Aside from the fact we had a controversial figure (Cee-Lo), we had some rarities on these two episode: Sudden Death and a 3-round shutout."
1351,998,1,jpgenius ,An OK start to our leftover episodes.
1352,999,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Man, a 4 point loss for the Hoopers, if Alicia would’ve said chaps for that final question, or if the final #1 would’ve been given, they would’ve won."
1353,999,2,jpgenius ,"The Hoopers’ FM loss hurt, but welcome back, Johnsons!"
1354,1000,1,jpgenius ,"One more, Johnsons, one more…and good work, Goodners!"
1355,1001,1,jpgenius ,GO JOHNSONS! Their big win is WELL-deserved. 🚗💵🎊
1356,1002,1,jpgenius ,"Great matches, as usual."
1357,1003,1,jpgenius ,The Goodners crack me up. 😂
1358,1004,1,jpgenius ,"One more, Goodners. One more…"
1359,1005,1,Adam Alam ,Yay! You got around to posting the recap!
1360,1005,2,jpgenius ,"These two episodes were FUN to watch, especially the second one. They left me in stitches. 😂"
1361,1006,1,jpgenius ,"Sorry, Goodners. (The Aranas spoiled it with #2.) 😥 But I like the Aranas. 😉"
1362,1007,1,jpgenius ,"Keep it going, Aranas. 👏🏾 And welcome back, Tennants!"
1363,1008,1,jpgenius ,"One more, Aranas…"
1364,1009,1,jpgenius ,GO ARANAS! 👏🏾
1365,1010,1,Matthew Yothers ,"What a great way to celebrate Tyra’s 20th birthday today, as the Schroeders are now $20,000 richer."
1366,1010,2,jpgenius ,Happy birthday Tyra! Great start to a “new” season (I technically counted October 5-21 as season 21).
1367,1011,1,jpgenius ,The Schroeder’s are on FIRE! 🔥
1368,1011,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Wow, “Touchdown” Tommy got 160 points both times in Fast Money so far, and they got $40,000. WTG Schroeders!"
1369,1011,3,Matthew Yothers ,"By the way, what does TCS mean?"
1370,1011,4,jpgenius ,Total clean sweep.
1371,1012,1,jpgenius ,"These two episodes were OK, but I hate to see the Schroeders go. And this is strange…why is the Opals’ second game…in the second run? 🤨"
1372,1013,1,jpgenius ,"Great work, Bazos! But OUCH at the first FM. 😥"
1373,1014,1,jpgenius ,"Keep it going, Bazos. And nice work by the Drurys!"
1374,1015,1,jpgenius ,A hurricane isn’t a place. 😬 And the Bazos are hot! 🔥
1375,1016,1,jpgenius ,Nice way to close out the season. And the top answer for the superhero question was indeed Batman.
1376,1017,1,jpgenius ,"Sorry, Bazos. 😥 I hate to see them (and the Drurys) depart. And boy, the entire second episode was a roller coaster."
1377,1017,2,Rohan Johnson ,"Yup, and after Daniel got 139 points, Maureen crawled a little too much at the end. but let’s look on the bright side. the Bazos are still leaving with $41,595, and it’s actually good enough for them to buy a car."
1378,1020,1,Rohan Johnson ,WOW! A miracle FM by The Washingtons!
1379,1021,1,Rohan Johnson ,Welcome back Casal Family!
1380,1022,1,Rohan Johnson ,2 FM wins in a ROW?! Wow! 😁 Good job Casal and Harris Families.
1381,1023,1,jpgenius ,"The Harrises have gotten HOT! 🔥 And one more, Casals, one more…"
1382,1024,1,jpgenius ,GO CASALS! 🚙💵
1383,1025,1,jpgenius ,"One more, Harrises, one more… 😏"
1384,1026,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Wow, another $60,000 winner in the Steve Harvey era. The Harris family won the car, and are driving out of here with $61,420. WTG, Harrises."
1385,1026,2,jpgenius ,GO HARRISES!!! 💵💵💵🚙👏🏾
1386,1026,3,Matthew Yothers ,"Also, Cedric from the McClinic family explained that he lost both of his legs in Afghanistan."
1387,1026,4,Matthew Yothers ,So he had to do the show in prosthetics.
1388,1027,1,Matthew Yothers ,"For that last question, “something parents are always telling their kids to shut”, the #1 answer was actually the door/fridge."
1389,1027,2,jpgenius ,"Third times the charm – WTG Abbates! And welcome back, Broadous family."
1390,1028,1,jpgenius ,"One more, Abbates. One more…"
1391,1029,1,jpgenius ,"GO ABBATES! 🚙💵 And great work finally winning $20K, Broadouses! One more…"
1392,1030,1,jpgenius ,"Sorry, Broadouses. And the Kinders came OH so close in FM. 😥"
1393,1031,1,jpgenius ,"Nate sure lives up to his nickname (Nate the Great), and Khristina’s FM was a nail biter! Fun episodes all around. 😁"
1394,1032,1,jpgenius ,"Keep it going, Kindells. And one more, McClinics…"
1395,1033,1,Matthew Yothers ,"First, the Grier family vs the Hagemann family, then the Wester family vs the Gant family, then the Schmidt family vs the Woods family, then, the Flowers family vs the Matkin family, and NOW the McClinic family vs the Abbate family. We’ve just made it 5 times so far that we’ve had 2 car winners against each other."
1396,1033,2,Matthew Yothers ,This game also gave us three cars in a row in Group 1.
1397,1033,3,jpgenius ,GO MCCLINICS! 💵🚙
1398,1033,4,jpgenius ,"And I’m sorry, but “you can eat them both” took me OUT. 😂"
1399,1034,1,jpgenius ,"OH so close for the McGraws… 😬 But keep it going, Thomases."
1400,1035,1,jpgenius ,"Welcome back (again), Kargbos! And boy, the Tripps’ FM was pretty anticlimactic. 😬 Can’t wait to see them in January."
1401,1036,1,jpgenius ,The Aranas crushed it again.
1402,1037,1,jpgenius ,"The Ewers seem like fun (BTW they’re from Georgia, and Lainie’s an opera/classical singer). And I’m sad to see the Kargbos go, but at least they won $20K."
1403,1038,1,jpgenius ,GO JAMES! 👏🏾
1404,1039,1,jpgenius ,I can’t wait for the Hedgecoths to come back. 😂
1405,1040,1,jpgenius ,OUCH – I SO wanted Connor to make a comeback. 😬
1406,1041,1,jpgenius ,3rd time’s the charm – GO NIKKI! 👏🏾
1407,1042,1,jpgenius ,The Hedgecoths are on FIRE! 🔥 Great FM teamwork by both winning families!
1408,1043,1,jpgenius ,"Man. I’m sorry, Hedgecoths. 😔"
1409,1044,1,jpgenius ,Fatima cracked me UP in FM! 😂 But bummer for the Joneses in their round.
1410,1045,1,jpgenius ,GO STEVEN!!! And Shannon! 👏🏾
1411,1046,1,Matthew Yothers ,"The Rahns actually competed on the Feud three years ago when the Nguyen family shut them out for the car, and they are back for revenge."
1412,1046,2,jpgenius ,"Welcome back, Rahns! Can’t wait to see them and the Jacksons return next week."
1413,1047,1,jpgenius ,Go Dwayne and Kelly! 👏🏾
1414,1048,1,jpgenius ,"One more, Rahns. One more…and the Armstrongs seem like fun."
1415,1049,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Wow, this 2nd match now makes it 6 times we’ve had two cars winners against each other. 3 years ago, the Rahn family was up against the Nguyen family, and the Nguyens shut them out to get the car in that game."
1416,1049,2,jpgenius ,"A car and another 20 grand? GO RAHNS! 👏🏾🚙💵 And nice work in FM, Lawrence!"
1417,1050,1,jpgenius ,The second match was hilarious. 😂
1418,1051,1,jpgenius ,"Welcome back, Anthonys! And the Armstrongs have gotten HOT! 🔥 One more, folks… 🚙"
1419,1052,1,jpgenius ,"Sorry, Armstrongs. 😔 But I enjoyed our Louisiana champs."
1420,1053,1,jpgenius ,"Go Shelby! 👏🏾 And man, Janetta sure tried in FM."
1421,1054,1,jpgenius ,"Nice job in FM, Pughs! (BTW the last top answer was Democrat.) But I’m sad to see the Seguras go, they seemed like fun."
1422,1055,1,Matthew Yothers ,"In the first game, Daniel was the one who went first in Fast Money, not David."
1423,1055,2,jpgenius ,"The Pughs have gotten HOT! 🔥 And great job in FM, Daniel! 👏🏾"
1424,1056,1,jpgenius ,"One more, Pughs…one more… 🤞🏾 And I enjoyed the first match. I can’t wait to see our champs return next week. 😉"
1425,1057,1,jpgenius ,"The Ortiz boys better keep it up, they’ve gotten HOT! 🔥 And great car-winning comeback by the Pughs! 👏🏾🚗"
1426,1058,1,jpgenius ,"Great run, Ortiz boys. And awesome Sudden Death wins by the new champs!"
1427,1058,2,Rohan Johnson ,"Yup, but sad to see the Browns miss by 14 in Fast Money."
1428,1059,1,Rohan Johnson ,"Great job in Fast Money Brewer Family, But man, Another painful FM lost by the Brown Family? Ouch!"
1429,1059,2,Rohan Johnson ,"I meant the Denards, and I also meant loss."
1430,1060,1,jpgenius ,It’s very unusual to see a family NOT win FM after 3 days.
1431,1060,2,Rohan Johnson ,"Yup, and I’m also sad to see the Denards go."
1432,1060,3,jpgenius ,"Yeah, they were good players. They survived Sudden Death – twice. But Marcos’ answer in the triple-point question had us cracking up. 😂"
1433,1061,1,Matthew Yothers ,"I just found out that the Trust girls competed on the Feud three years ago and won twice there. I’m glad they finally got the $20,000 this time, but I feel bad that the Brown family missed out on the car and failed to get $20,000. Good luck on getting that car tomorrow, Trust girls!"
1434,1061,2,jpgenius ,"Sorry, Browns. But I hope the Trust ladies win a car. (Back-to-back car games in the same run?) 😏"
1435,1062,1,jpgenius ,"Great run, Montás family. The new champs in both runs seem like fun."
1436,1063,1,jpgenius ,"Our new champs cracked me up. I can’t wait to see them in April (or May). 😂 (By the way, the Paganos weren’t shutout, they had some points.)"
1437,1064,1,jpgenius ,"Welcome back, Mokiaos! It’s so refreshing to see a family from Hawaii win the Feud this season. Aloha! 👏🏾"
1438,1065,1,Matthew Yothers ,Where’s the Mokiaos family? Aren’t they supposed to come back for their third time today?
1439,1065,2,jpgenius ,"Time commitments, perhaps."
1440,1065,3,Matthew Yothers ,"Well, we still don’t know when the Zhang family will be back to play for the car either, we haven’t seen them since 2019."
1441,1065,4,jpgenius ,"I’m surprised the Mokiaos aren’t returning (at least for now), but the Starks tried in FM."
1442,1066,1,jpgenius ,Go Carly! 👏🏾
1443,1067,1,jpgenius ,The first question was just nasty. Dorothy is a CHILD! 🤢
1444,1068,1,jpgenius ,"Welp, at least we’ll see if the Starks win a car on Monday. 😏"
1445,1069,1,jpgenius ,"Two FM wins AND a car? WTG Starks! 👏🏾🚙 And welcome back, Thomases. 😉"
1446,1070,1,Alan ,"Good first episode undone by that nightcap result – that’s what deepscan would probably call a 50/50 split day for Harvey.
Chain Reaction (BR win) is our only big winner so far today, with W & J still pending."
1447,1070,2,jpgenius ,"Welcome back, Joneses! 🎷"
1448,1071,1,jpgenius ,Great comeback by Ray Jr.! Both of these episodes had me ROLLING. 😂😂😂
1449,1072,1,Alan ,"From ‘The Kelly Clarkson Show”:

1450,1072,2,jpgenius ,"That’s a lot of recent returning families. Welcome back, Crovettos. This family and the Brewers are FUNNY. 😂"
1451,1073,1,jpgenius ,Yay Brewers! Let’s get one more win on Monday… 🚙
1452,1074,1,Alan ,"Fast Money Win + Fast Money Win On Same Day Nightcap = Today’s Leader, going into the Sony Syndies."
1453,1074,2,Alan ,"…And with those two shows middling out, Harvey is awarded for the game show with the best performance today.
Had to be careful there, almost gave it to Gino D’Acampo instead."
1454,1074,3,jpgenius ,"Sorry, Brewers. 😔 But the Carswells seem like fun and I’m happy to see them win $20K, as well as the Crovettos! Go Alexandra! 👏🏾"
1455,1075,1,jpgenius ,Whoa – a car win AND Mary Beth’s miraculous FM comeback? What a day for the Crovettos! 👏🏾💵🚙🎊
1456,1075,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Wow, Fast Money comeback of the century, they got 200 right on the nose."
1457,1076,1,Matthew Yothers ,Is today’s Group 2 game the second game in which we have two returning families after a car win?
1458,1076,2,jpgenius ,"Whew, Jimmy got lucky with his last two answers! 💨 And welcome back to all our returning families, especially the Burtons. They seem like fun. 😉"
1459,1077,1,Alan ,"From fellow daytime denzien ‘The Kelly Clarkson Show’:
"
1460,1077,2,jpgenius ,I enjoyed the Cooks and Kyles. They had me in STITCHES. 😂
1461,1080,1,Matthew Yothers ,We now have 7 match-ups with 2 car winners against each other when we had the Crovettos vs the Burtons less than 2 weeks ago.
1462,1080,2,Nick Brundidge ,Congratulations to both families
1463,1080,3,jpgenius ,"TWO car wins in one night?! That hasn’t happened in YEARS! Congrats, Lathams and Burtons! I enjoyed them. 🚙💵🎊👏🏾"
1464,1081,1,jpgenius ,"Welcome back, Kyles! All four families seem like fun."
1465,1083,1,jpgenius ,Go Cofills! And the Phillips seem like a laugh riot. (But I’m sad to see the Mokiaos go.)
1466,1083,2,jpgenius ,I meant to say *Coffils.*
1467,1083,3,Matthew Yothers ,"It’s good to see the Mokiaos again after waiting to come back for less than a month. And they are leaving with $20,000 after their brilliant performance last time."
1468,1084,1,jpgenius ,Go Tyler! And the Youngs are hilarious. 😂
1469,1085,1,jpgenius ,Can’t wait to see the Youngs and Williams next week.
1470,1086,1,jpgenius ,Go Derrick! 👏🏾
1471,1087,1,jpgenius ,"It’s OK, Ah Yous and Lloyds. We’ll get ‘em next time."
1472,1088,1,jpgenius ,"Nice work, Shannons! And GO JESSI! No one’s gotten all the top answers in years! 👏🏾"
1473,1089,1,Matthew Yothers ,"I saw in a YouTube video that the challenging family in game 2 is actually the Hollingsworth family, not the Collingsworth family."
1474,1089,2,jpgenius ,Bummed to see the Shannons and Lehmans go.
1475,1090,1,jpgenius ,"Whew, Kierstin’s FM was suspenseful but it all worked out! Can’t wait to see the Kidwells and Hollingsworths next week. 😉"

1477,1092,1,jpgenius ,Go Terrie! 👏🏾
1478,1092,2,Matthew Yothers ,"I agree, and in the 2nd game, Cheryl from the Kincaid family was gone for part of the game. Where was she?"
1479,1092,3,jpgenius ,I just noticed that! What the heck?! 😳
1480,1093,1,Alan ,"Missed it by *that* much, and by my reckoning (correct me if I’m wrong), that’s a Daytime Car Shutout.
Only Elizabeth Banks can save our Wednesday now.  (Go Whammies!)"
1481,1093,2,jpgenius ,"Poor Kidwells and Kincaids. No car for the former, and a close FM loss for the latter. 😔"
1482,1093,3,Colin Roley ,Speaking of family feud coming back in september its time for the Audience to come back and social distancing go Bye Bye
1483,1095,1,Alan ,(spoiler)
1484,1095,2,jpgenius ,Happy birthday Sheryl! This was a fun celebratory episode. 😁
1485,1096,1,Alan ,"To borrow deepscan’s scoring system, a 50/50 split result here, but a losing show for everyone not nicknamed ‘Beastie’, means a losing night for the Alpha-Net (no winnings up for grabs on ‘Truth’).  That leaves Elizabeth, Michael and Joel to bail them out on Wednesday; at least two winning shows are needed (IMHO)."
1486,1096,2,jpgenius ,Quite a mixed bag of fun episodes.
1487,1097,1,jpgenius ,I’m glad Terry Bradshaw returned. 😂
1488,1099,1,jpgenius ,The first episode had me cracking up! 😂😂😂
1489,1103,1,jpgenius ,"Although grown-ish is a show my mom loves, the cast of Good Trouble cracked me up. 😂 And it’s awesome to see a rare inevitable Sudden Death (where it would happen whether or not the opposing team stole)."
1490,1104,1,jpgenius ,I had no idea how funny Jimmie Allen and his teammates were. 😂😂😂
1491,1105,1,zhifos12 ,"The Chase was preempted tonight for a special about the Fall of Afghanistan. After it was over, ABC showed a rerun from earlier in the season."
1492,1105,2,Alan ,"My heart goes out to all those who served/fought/worked for 20 years to make that a better place, only to have others unnamed (I won’t get too political here, but both administrations will have to share the blame IMHO) undo it all in less than 20 weeks.  It’s Saigon all over again.  No words.
(CNN reporting tonight that Taliban fighters are being ordered not to prevent civilian evacuees from leaving.)"
1493,1105,3,jpgenius ,"Both of these episodes were funny, but the end of the first one was a MAJOR disappointment. Who doesn’t clap in church?! 😳"
1494,1106,1,jpgenius ,"GO WARRICK! This was an interesting Disney special, to say the least. The decorations looked awesome, and it gives me hope that we may have Halloween or Christmas specials or even a Big Money Tournament/Bonus Week."
1495,1107,1,jpgenius ,"These two matches were hilarious, and the MLB alums were pretty energetic, especially Hunter and Dallas. 😂"
1496,1108,1,jpgenius ,"Joe, Joe, Joe … I’m at a loss for words. 😬"
1497,1109,1,Alex Coleman ,"The #1 answer to the 4th question was the pool, and the #1 answer to the Dwarves question was Dopey"
1498,1109,2,jpgenius ,Thanks. I was wondering why Steve didn’t mention those answers.
1499,1109,3,jpgenius ,"Hilarious episodes as always, especially the first one. Fran cracked me up! 😂"
1500,1110,1,jpgenius ,"Both of these episodes had their quirks, but I couldn’t keep a straight face during Chynna’s Fast Money chant."
1501,1111,1,jpgenius ,"Nice job, Rhodes ladies! 📣"
1502,1112,1,Matthew Yothers ,"And flower shop is worth 57, not 59."
1503,1112,2,jpgenius ,"It’s OK, Georgette. There’s always next time."
1504,1113,1,jpgenius ,Go Joshea! 👏🏾
1505,1114,1,jpgenius ,Very rare to see a South Dakota clan on the Feud. And they did great in Fast Money.
1506,1114,2,jpgenius ,"BTW, I think the Whites tried to go to Sudden Death with “go” (like the traffic light), not “gold.”"
1507,1115,1,jpgenius ,"Keep it going, Zomers."
1508,1116,1,jpgenius ,Go Kincaids! 👏🏾
1509,1117,1,Alan ,Not even Harvey had a good day today.  Matt wins another one by default.
1510,1117,2,jpgenius ,"Good run, Kincaids. And the Alcos family had me cracking up. 😂"
1511,1118,1,jpgenius ,"Nice job, Tuckers! But I wasn’t expecting Alicia’s “work” answer in R2. 😱"
1512,1119,1,jpgenius ,Would you like me to send you a recap?
1513,1119,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Why 6 pairs of underwear?! That’s not a nice rounded number. If I were asked that question, I would say 10."
1514,1120,1,jpgenius ,Very interesting last couple of rounds.
1515,1121,1,Matthew Yothers ,Wow! Go Grace! She just put up the biggest comeback ever in Family Feud history in this era.
1516,1121,2,Matthew Yothers ,Wow! Go Grace! She just put up the biggest comeback ever in Family Feud history in this era.
1517,1121,3,Matthew Yothers ,Sorry about the repeat.
1518,1121,4,Dylan Orndorff ,Awesome comeback for Grace!
1519,1121,5,jpgenius ,GO GRACE!!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 And the Bonitatibus family seem like fun. 😁
1520,1121,6,Matthew Yothers ,And both Dale & Rocky II shocked their wives (Myra & Lori) on that second question.
1521,1122,1,jpgenius ,WTG Bonitatibus family! 👏🏾 I can’t wait to see the Kings next week.
1522,1123,1,jpgenius ,"See you next week, Bonitatibus family."
1523,1124,1,jpgenius ,"Nice work, Germanys!"
1524,1125,1,jpgenius ,"Good work, Patels. And I wasn’t expecting THAT answer in Round 2 of game 2."
1525,1126,1,jpgenius ,The Germanys are on a nice little roll.
1526,1127,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Wow, the Germanys are killing this Fast Money, $60,000 is 4 shows?! We haven’t seen that since Richard Karn hosted this show."
1527,1127,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And for Game 2, I found out that the Dukers won, but do you know what happened in Fast Money?"
1528,1127,3,jpgenius ,The Dukers won $20K.
1529,1127,4,Matthew Yothers ,And who did Fast Money here?
1530,1127,5,jpgenius ,CJ and Liz.
1531,1127,6,jpgenius ,"WHOA, the Germanys are REALLY hot! 🔥"
1532,1128,1,Matthew Yothers ,"I’m just wondering, how much money did the Dukers win last time?"
1533,1128,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Never mind, I just found out that they won the $20,000 in the previous game."
1534,1128,3,jpgenius ,"Welp, although I’m bummed the Germanys didn’t win the car 😔, they have over $60K+, so I can’t complain. 😉"
1535,1129,1,jpgenius ,The Dukers are doubling down! 🔥
1536,1130,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Game 2 is the Duker family vs the Wolowiec family (Barbara, Kristine, Kevin, Kaitlyn, & Carol)"
1537,1130,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, I found out that the Wolowiecs won the game, but does anyone know what happened in Fast Money yet?"
1538,1130,3,Dylan Orndorff ,Carla and Barbara won $5 a point for a total of $725 they scored 145 points in fast money
1539,1130,4,Dylan Orndorff ,Carol and Barbara won $5 a point for a total of $725 they scored 145 points in fast money
1540,1130,5,jpgenius ,"Nice job, Eddings! And I’m sad to see the Dukers go, but they have nothing to sneeze at."
1541,1130,6,Matthew Yothers ,"I agree, I feel bad that they won’t compete for the car, but $40,660 in 3 games is very respectable."
1542,1131,1,Matthew Yothers ,"And the second group game is the Wolowiecs vs the Martins which consist of Eugene, Sonia, Tino, Olivia, & I don’t know the name of the last member though, does anyone know his name?"
1543,1131,2,jpgenius ,The last member’s name is Alex.
1544,1131,3,Matthew Yothers ,"And one more comment here, the Wolowiecs won again, they brought Kristine and Kevin out this time, and they only managed to score 136 points for another $680, giving them a 2-day total of $1,405."
1545,1131,4,Matthew Yothers ,The Fast Money results are on YouTube if you want to see what happened.
1546,1131,5,jpgenius ,"Welcome back, Talaricos."
1547,1132,1,Matthew Yothers ,"The second group game is the Wolowiecs vs the Smiths who competed on Monday, they’re back for their second time due to a mistake."
1548,1132,2,Matthew Yothers ,"But man, were the Forbeses so close to winning that $20,000! They missed it by one crumby point. Had Kelli said violin for that last question, or if any of the remaining #1s were given, they would’ve won."
1549,1132,3,Matthew Yothers ,"Well, better luck next time Forbeses, I really hope you guys get it next time. I really do!"
1550,1132,4,Matthew Yothers ,Can anyone please recap or tell me what happened in Game 2?
1551,1132,5,Matthew Yothers ,"And tell me about Fast Money, too."
1552,1132,6,jpgenius ,"The Smiths won this time, but David and Alonzo got $860 in Fast Money."
1553,1132,7,jpgenius ,"Poor Forbes. 😥 But welcome back, Smiths! Their energy is refreshing."
1554,1133,1,Nicholas Brundidge ,Who won the second game
1555,1133,2,jpgenius ,"The Wizners (all siblings) from Douglasville, GA. They include Chris, Greg, Cathy, Jimmy, and Amy. Chris and Jimmy got 217 points in Fast Money for $20K."
1556,1133,3,Nick Brundidge ,Thank you
1557,1133,4,Nicholas Brundidge ,What were the questions on the fast money round?
1558,1133,5,jpgenius ,"My goodness, the producers are gonna have to fix the stage after the Roberts’ epic episode. 😂 Just kidding, they’re a lot of fun to watch! Also nice to see the Wizners win $20K."
1559,1133,6,Matthew Yothers ,Correction: the 5th question should be “Name something a dog sees on TV that would cause it to start barking.”
1560,1133,7,Matthew Yothers ,"Also, it is NEVER a good idea to text a naked picture of someone, even yourself."
1561,1134,1,jpgenius ,The second round of the first game had me ROLLING. 😂😂😂
1562,1135,1,jpgenius ,"The Roberts are on a ROLL! 🔥 But, man I feel bad for the Wizners missing FM by such a narrow margin. 😔"
1563,1136,1,jpgenius ,WTG Wizners! 🔥 Now let’s see how the doubleheader goes…
1564,1137,1,Matthew Yothers ,"YES, the Roberts family won the car and another $20,000! That’s $61,745 total! #1 in the Steve Harvey era! GO WENDY AND RENEE!"
1565,1137,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And in Game 2, the Wizners were up against the Krings family which consists of Julie, Tyler, Kyle, Allie, & Markus."
1566,1137,3,Matthew Yothers ,"And unfortunately, the Wizners missed out on their car here. The Krings family won the game."
1567,1137,4,jpgenius ,"Well, it’s a bummer that the Wizners didn’t win the car and the Krings missed FM by 12. You can’t win ‘em all. 😔"
1568,1137,5,Matthew Yothers ,"You’re right jp, and they can still pay for a car with $41,595 as well."
1569,1137,6,Matthew Yothers ,"They brought Tyler & Kyle out for Fast Money, but does anyone know which order they did, and whether they won or not? If not, how much money did they win for $5 a point?"
1570,1137,7,Matthew Yothers ,"Never mind, I just found out, Kyle went first and got 140 points, but Tyler just couldn’t quite bring it home. He only brought them up to 188 for $940. Better luck next time, guys."
1571,1137,8,jpgenius ,"The Krings are from Byron, MN (near Rochester)."
1572,1137,9,jpgenius ,"WHOA – $61K+ AND a car?! Roberts family, YOU ROCK!!! 🚗💵👏🏾🎊"
1573,1137,10,jpgenius ,"Oh, and the Higgins are from Catonsville, MD."
1574,1138,1,jpgenius ,The same FM score with the same number of answers leads to the same result. Kudos to the winnings teams! 👏🏾
1575,1138,2,jpgenius ,winning*
1576,1139,1,jpgenius ,The Esteps’ FM had me ROLLING. 😂😂😂
1577,1140,1,jpgenius ,"Welcome back, Ahunas. And great job, Barreras! They’re quite the interesting family."
1578,1141,1,jpgenius ,$40K already?! The Barreras are HOT! 🔥
1579,1142,1,Nicholas Brundidge ,Who won on the second game?
1580,1142,2,Matthew Yothers ,"The Barreras did, they forced Sudden Death in the end and they won it, but Jay and Laura only managed to get 134 points this time for another $670."
1581,1142,3,Matthew Yothers ,"But that still gives them an impressive 3-day total of $40,670."
1582,1142,4,Matthew Yothers ,"And today they were up against the Morrison family, which consists of Cyndi, her daughter Alex, her husband Michael, her son Avery, and her other daughter Danielle."
1583,1142,5,jpgenius ,"And the Morrisons are from Yorba Linda, CA (Orange County)."
1584,1142,6,Nicholas Brundidge ,What was the sudden death question
1585,1142,7,Matthew Yothers ,The question was: “Name something a bald man might put on his head to impress a woman.” and Gaby immediately got the top answer with a toupee to give them win #3.
1586,1142,8,jpgenius ,Steve only got up to “impress.”
1587,1142,9,jpgenius ,"Well, let’s see if the Ahunas can finally win $20K and a car next time…"
1588,1143,1,jpgenius ,GO AHUNAS! Angela wins her first car and her family finally wins $20K to take home – what an night! 🚗💵
1589,1143,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And with that car win, we now have 8 matches with two car winners against each other, with this recent one being the Ahuna family vs the Roberts family."
1590,1144,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Ladies, I’m gonna make myself clear on this, never ever ask for a divorce before Christmas."
1591,1144,2,Nicholas Brundidge ,You know I thought charity was a good answer
1592,1144,3,Nicholas Brundidge ,Well this is heart-breaking
1593,1144,4,jpgenius ,The Farrellys’ passing strategy paid off quite nicely. But it’s a bummer the Barreras didn’t win the car. At least they have a lot of money. 😕
1594,1145,1,jpgenius ,Great job to the new champs! Especially the Goffredos! They seem like fun. 😁
1595,1146,1,jpgenius ,"Go Angela! 👏🏾 And boy, Rufus’ FM was just as gripping as Chris’. But it all worked out. 😬"
1596,1147,1,Nick Brundidge ,Who won the second game?
1597,1147,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Wow, 4 years ago, the Kendricks lost the car, but now they seeked redemption and won it back just like the Stowers family did. Way to go, guys!"
1598,1147,3,Matthew Yothers ,"Too bad they couldn’t quite get the money though, but they’re still leaving us with $22,890 along with their car."
1599,1147,4,Matthew Yothers ,"The Ruffin family won Game 2, they had all the points before Sudden Death, and they won with that. But in Fast Money, Toni & Taylor only managed to score 166 points for $830."
1600,1147,5,Matthew Yothers ,Fast Money’s on YouTube if you want to see it.
1601,1147,6,Matthew Yothers ,"And the Ruffin family consisted of Taylor, her mom Tiffany, her aunt (Tiffany’s twin sister) Tegi, her little brother Joshua, and her grandma Toni."
1602,1147,7,jpgenius ,GO KENDRICKS!!! That’s what I call a return trip! 🚗👏🏾🎊
1603,1147,8,Matthew Yothers ,And isn’t rolling around in the bed the same as tossing & turning?
1604,1148,1,jpgenius ,Go Ruffins! 👏🏾
1605,1149,1,jpgenius ,"Oh, what could’ve been a cherry on top of the Talamantez family’s comeback… 😬"
1606,1150,1,jpgenius ,The Ruffins are on FIRE! 🔥
1607,1151,1,jpgenius ,"Sigh, we just can’t get a car win in the second run, can we? Sorry, Ruffins. 😔"
1608,1152,1,jpgenius ,"Another Disney special? I’m pleasantly surprised. Well, it’s nice to see the Hetzels return."
1609,1153,1,Alan ,"Today’s overall game show winner by default.  By clocking up wins in both Fast Money rounds (rare outside of the primetime celebrity edition), he gets to rub the collective noses of everyone else in it."
1610,1153,2,jpgenius ,"Nice work, champs! 👏🏾"
1611,1154,1,jpgenius ,These two episodes had me in STITCHES. 😂
1612,1154,2,jpgenius ,"By the way, Hannah is actually Kristin’s daughter."
1613,1155,1,jpgenius ,"Go, Strouds! And the Gibbs are HOT! 🔥"
1614,1155,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And for that car question, I’m pretty sure Devante said self-park, not sell parts."
1615,1156,1,Rohan Johnson ,"MAN! Now I remember that both of the Ruffin family did win $40.000 💵💴💰💷 and lost the🚗 against the Gibbs family in the sudden death round. I am so glad that the Gibbs family won $40.000 💵💴💰💷, but I DO feel bad for the Gibbs family because they did lose the🚗  in the sudden death round against the Awosika family. 😑"
1616,1156,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And actually, Ali said “coffee machine”, not “copy machine”."
1617,1156,3,jpgenius ,"Man, we just can’t get a car win in the second run, can we? Sorry, Gibbs. 😔 But welcome back, Arbogasts. And the Awosikas seem like fun."
1618,1157,1,jpgenius ,Go Matthew! 👏🏾
1619,1158,1,jpgenius ,"Great work, Walkers! How did they get “manatee?!” And I dunno where the Fishers got their answers in the double-point question."
1620,1159,1,jpgenius ,"The Gonzales family are HOT! 🔥 But man, what a close call for the Walkers. (Hold up – did Maia say what I think she said for the triple-point question?! 😳)"
1621,1160,1,jpgenius ,MAN! Poor Barthleys. 😔 But the Gonzales family had a great run.
1622,1161,1,jpgenius ,"Welcome back, Kahans. I thought the last top answer of their FM would be poker."
1623,1162,1,jpgenius ,"I can’t wait to see the Neslers and Kahans next week. And go, Christine! 👏🏾"
1624,1163,1,jpgenius ,The Kahans are HOT! 🔥 But I couldn’t believe Eboni’s answer to the second question.
1625,1164,1,jpgenius ,"Poor Kahans. 😔 But welcome back, Dorseys! I had a funky good ol’ time watching them."
1626,1165,1,jpgenius ,"Nice run, Neslers. And congrats to the new champs, especially the Meskers! They’re more exciting than I imagined they were."
1627,1166,1,Matthew Yothers ,And the second game for today was the first Walt Disney special on the Feud. (Mesker vs Scott).
1628,1166,2,jpgenius ,"And tomorrow’s second-run episode will likely be Scott vs. Hetzel, so we’ll see the Hetzels on Monday."
1629,1166,3,jpgenius ,$40K already?! The Enriquezes are on a roll! 🔥
1630,1167,1,Matthew Yothers ,The second game today was the second Disney special they did in November. (Hetzel vs Scott)
1631,1167,2,jpgenius ,"Great job, Enriquez family. Can’t wait to see the Jemiolos and Hetzels next week. 😉"
1632,1168,1,jpgenius ,"Your dead mother’s tooth?! 😂 Oh, and congrats to the new champs in the second round. (Interestingly, the Hetzels defeated a Daniels family – with an S – back in 2017.)"
1633,1169,1,ant0824 ,Cedric’s Needed only 52 and he failed miserably with cheap answers from Game 2. Game 1 went good
1634,1169,2,jpgenius ,"Nice job, Seiters!"
1635,1170,1,jpgenius ,The Daniels have gotten HOT! 🔥
1636,1171,1,jpgenius ,Congrats to the new champs in both games! And the Daniels’ total is nothing to sneeze at (they actually would’ve gone to Sudden Death had the DiFedes NOT stolen the last answer).
1637,1172,1,jpgenius ,"$40K already?! The Jeannises are on FIRE! 🔥 I can’t wait to see them and the DiFedes next week. (By the way, Steve was sooo wrong for having Aleah sing her answers.)"
1638,1173,1,jpgenius ,"Keep it going, Jeannis family. And great job in FM, Ani!"
1639,1174,1,jpgenius ,"Great FM teamwork, Moores. Speaking of Moore… one more, Jeannis family, one more…"
1640,1175,1,jpgenius ,Sigh… poor Jeannis family. I think someone said “gun.” 😔
1641,1176,1,jpgenius ,"That’s how you make a comeback, Johnsons! And I’m glad both families won FM, especially the Mentos. They seem like fun."
1642,1177,1,jpgenius ,"I can’t wait to see the Mentos and DiFedes next week. They’ve gotten HOT, especially the DiFedes! They came out of nowhere! 🔥"
1643,1178,1,Nicholas Brundidge ,I was worried that the Difedes weren’t going to win the car. But they did!
1644,1178,2,jpgenius ,"Finally, a car win! GO DIFEDES! 🚗👏🏾"
1645,1178,3,jpgenius ,"Also, I was bummed to see the Mentos go. But they still did great."
1646,1178,4,jpgenius ,"Also, I was bummed to see the Mentos go. But they still did great."
1647,1179,1,jpgenius ,Welcome back to all our families (particularly the Blackstones). I love seeing a double FM win. 👏🏾
1648,1180,1,Nicholas Brundidge ,WOW! This has never happened before
1649,1181,1,jpgenius ,"WOW – the rare occasion when passing the last survey backfires. But nice work, Turners! 👏🏾"
1650,1182,1,jpgenius ,The Nobles seem like a ton of fun! GO TONI! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
1651,1183,1,Nicholas Brundidge ,Thank God I thought the Wolowiecs were not going to win that car but yet they did
1652,1183,2,jpgenius ,GO WOLOWIECS!!! 👏🏾🚗💵
1653,1184,1,Matthew Yothers ,Okay. I completely don’t understand this first Fast Money question in Game 2.
1654,1184,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Oh. Okay, I found out the full question was “Acc. to married guys money can buy LOVE & good loving if you buy what for your wife?”"
1655,1184,3,Matthew Yothers ,And dress to impress was actually worth 45 points.
1656,1184,4,jpgenius ,"Congrats to the champs, particularly the Walkers! They seem like fun."
1657,1185,1,jpgenius ,"Nice comeback, Crosbys! And while the Pittards had me cracking up, Katie made a great effort in FM."
1658,1186,1,jpgenius ,"The underwear question had me in STITCHES. 😂😂😂 But great teamwork in FM, Van Horns!"
1659,1187,1,jpgenius ,The Crosbys are HOT! 🔥
1660,1188,1,Nicholas Brundidge ,"Hopefully both families win a car because if not, I’m going to be upset"
1661,1188,2,Matthew Yothers ,"With this Fast Money win, that now gives the Curney family a 4-day total of $40,960."
1662,1188,3,jpgenius ,"A future car game was inevitable in the first run. Welcome back, Curneys! They’re on a ROLL, alongside the Van Horns! 🔥"
1663,1189,1,Nicholas Brundidge ,Two car losses in one day! I cannot believe it
1664,1189,2,Rohan Johnson ,"Yeah, I just wanted both of them to win the car. but let’s look on the bright side. they are both still leaving with $40.000 though so that’s good enough for them to pay for a car. plus, I’m glad that the Evans crushed fast money on their second game."
1665,1189,3,Rohan Johnson ,"Yeah, I just wanted both of them to win the car. but let’s look on the bright side. they are still leaving with $40.000. plus, that is actually good enough for them to pay for a car."
1666,1189,4,jpgenius ,"MAN, one car loss in a doubleheader sucks, but two?! That hurts. 😔 Well, at least the Curneys and Van Horns have plenty of money to take home."
1667,1190,1,jpgenius ,Nice work in FM by the champs! Wait a sec – first Van Horn and now Sanborn?
1668,1191,1,jpgenius ,"Welcome back, Chappells! And Danielle and Tasha are fantastic FM players!"
1669,1192,1,jpgenius ,"Three clean sweeps and three $20K wins in a row in the first run? Talk about a hat trick! 👏🏾 Also, Peter Lane is fun to watch."
1670,1193,1,jpgenius ,"GO KEITH! The crowd really loves the Lane family, don’t they? 👏🏾"
1671,1194,1,jpgenius ,"Boy, I thought the Lanes were full of energy, but the Smiths gave them a run for their money and made a nice comeback! Too bad they couldn’t convert it to a FM win, but they brought the laughs. 😂"
1672,1195,1,jpgenius ,"Great comeback, Carters! And GO VICKI! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾"
1673,1196,1,Nicholas Brundidge ,Oh my!
1674,1196,2,jpgenius ,GO COURTNEY! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
1675,1197,1,jpgenius ,"Good run, Smith family. And congrats to the new champs!"
1676,1198,1,jpgenius ,"Boy, Steven scared me in FM, but he got the job done. 😌"
1677,1199,1,jpgenius ,"I can’t wait to see the new champs next week, especially the Holiens. I think they’re the first family from New Mexico to be on the Feud."
1678,1200,1,jpgenius ,"It’s OK, Garlands. You’ll be back. And great work in FM, Zayas family!"
1679,1201,1,jpgenius ,My condolences to the challengers. The ties and buttons are beautiful ways of honoring their loved ones.
1680,1202,1,jpgenius ,"Yay, Credes! And boy, the Zayas family have gotten HOT! 🔥"
1681,1203,1,jpgenius ,"Not very often you see a family get a second chance (or third, in the Smahas’ case). Great to see the Carswells double up!"
1682,1204,1,Nicholas Brundidge ,Well this is heartbreaking for the Zayas family
1683,1204,2,jpgenius ,"Sigh… that was probably our last chance at a car win this season, and it didn’t happen. Sorry, Zayas family. 😔"
1684,1205,1,jpgenius ,The Martins are on a nice little roll! 🔥
1685,1205,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And on the last question, I think the judges gave Kim credit for food."

1687,1207,1,jpgenius ,GO TRACI!!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 I can’t wait to see the Sissons and Shampains in September.
1688,1207,2,Andrew DeCaro ,This Might Have Been Steve Harvey’s Last and Final Epsiode of Family Feud. which will start in September. Because there might be a New host to replace Steve Harvey Next Season. Because he said he was done with Family Feud on his Instagram.
1689,1207,3,Colin Roley ,Definitely think it’s Time for the audience to come back on Family Feud for the 24th Season
1690,1209,1,jpgenius ,"Celebrity Feud is BACK! I was rooting for Abbott Elementary, but all of these families were hilarious. 😂"
1691,1210,1,ant0824 ,"I Love Celebs, They are so Fun especially my Favorite Love Josie Totah. I Love her so Much.  Wild & Fun Show all around especially Bel-Air winning & Salt-&-Pepa too"
1692,1210,2,jpgenius ,"Like every episode of Celebrity Feud, this one was a laugh riot. 😂😂😂"
1693,1211,1,jpgenius ,The TV show casts had me cracking up. 😂😂😂
1694,1212,1,jpgenius ,YIKES at the first Fast Money. I can’t believe no one said butter. 😳
1695,1212,2,Matthew Yothers ,And that last question on the first game was the “alligator” Fast Money all over again.
1696,1213,1,jpgenius ,Nicholas’ answers in FM had me ROLLING. (You should’ve seen the clips edited out.) 😂😂😂
1697,1213,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And Steve read the last question again, and Nicholas said the golf cart as the #1 answer there."
1698,1214,1,jpgenius ,GO RHYS!!! (And Michelle)! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
1699,1215,1,Alex Coleman ,"Ironically, Kathy Najimy was on Family Feud when she was on Gameshow Marathon in 2006 and she was the one who won"
1700,1215,2,jpgenius ,Kristin cracked me UP. 😂
1701,1216,1,jpgenius ,Monica’s team had me ROLLING. 😂😂😂
1702,1216,2,Matthew Yothers ,"If paper was worth 58 on that last question, then toner/ink should be worth the remaining 42."
1703,1217,1,jpgenius ,"Ah, the athletes’ episode. The first question of the second match was… interesting. 😏"
1704,1218,1,deepscan ,"We kick off a new Game Show Season with a perfect show—two FM gets in a row for a great play, with Harvey still at his Emmy -winning raunchy best!"
1705,1219,1,deepscan ,A double FM sweep kicks off our second week of our Game Show season.  Great game.
1706,1219,2,jpgenius ,I thought this was the season finale. But it still gave me a bunch of laughs. 😂😂😂
1707,1220,1,jpgenius ,"This is, by far, the CRAZIEST Family Feud match I’ve ever seen, celebrity or not. 😂😂😂"
1708,1221,1,Matthew Yothers ,Where’s the Shampain family? They’re supposed to be back this season.
1709,1221,2,Rohan Johnson ,"Yeah, it has been over a couple of years since the Woods missed their return trip back in Season 17. I also remember that the Zhang girls were going to play for their card, but never returned for their car day back in Season 20 because of the Gross Family who took over who versed against the Klein Family and lost against the Klein Family who lost the car in that season."
1710,1221,3,jpgenius ,"Great start to what could be a big season! While the Sissons are on a nice little roll, Maria LeBlanc had me rolling. 😂😂😂"
1711,1222,1,jpgenius ,"I can’t believe the Sissons finally took control of a survey after 11 of them, 2 wins, and $40,000. Too bad they didn’t win their 3rd match. As for #7 on the funeral question… what the fudge?! 😳"
1712,1223,1,jpgenius ,"Great teamwork in FM, Fields family! 👏🏾"

1716,1226,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Wait a minute here, the McKellums said a bench for the final answer, and it WAS up there. What the heck, guys?"
1717,1226,2,Matthew Yothers ,They need to bring the McKellum family back because of this.
1718,1226,3,jpgenius ,I think Bobby meant to write “statues.”
1719,1226,4,Matthew Yothers ,"Okay, fair enough."
1720,1226,5,Matthew Yothers ,"Wait, statues for which part? What the remaining answer was, or what the McKellums used for the steal?"
1721,1226,6,jpgenius ,“Statues” was the last remaining answer.
1722,1226,7,jpgenius ,Nice job in FM by the White family! And the Callahans are on a ROLL! 😁
1723,1227,1,jpgenius ,I couldn’t believe Leo actually said that in the triple-point round. 😬 And the Murrells sure tried to make a comeback…
1724,1228,1,Nick Brundidge ,This is the first car loss of the season! Plus I thought lips was a great answer.
1725,1228,2,jpgenius ,Go Chase! 👏🏾
1726,1229,1,jpgenius ,"Go Kangs! I can’t wait to see them and the Russells next week. (And Steve wasn’t too happy with the “Feud” being #2 on the game show survey, wasn’t he?)"
1727,1230,1,jpgenius ,"The first episode was a nice surprise (with the board game and all), and the Windings seem like fun! But the first half of the second episode had me cracking UP! 😂😂😂"

1729,1231,1,jpgenius ,"The Windings are on a ROLL, and the Goaleys score a (FM) goal! How fun! 👏🏾"
1730,1232,1,jpgenius ,"The Windings will be all right. They have $40K, two board games, and two Carnival cruises. Awesome run. 👍🏾"
1731,1233,1,jpgenius ,"That’s a lot of specials we’ ve had so far this season. Both episodes were fun to watch (and I’m happy to see the Langevins win $20K), but Cheap Carl is just plain NASTY. 🤢"
1732,1234,1,jpgenius ,"Great comeback, Cassandra! 👏🏾 (As for Ayah, giving Steve’s name as an answer worked this time. 😉)"
1733,1235,1,jpgenius ,"I’m sad to see the Roses go, but congrats to the new champs! They seem like fun. 😁 (And hooray for a family from North Dakota on the Feud!)"
1734,1236,1,jpgenius ,"Welcome back, Nobles! They’re on a nice little roll! Oh, and welcome back, Andersons! 👏🏾"
1735,1236,2,Matthew Yothers ,"And this $20,000 win will give the Noble family a 4-day total of $40,845, and they get to play for the car next time."
1736,1236,3,Matthew Yothers ,"Well done, Toni and Kevin."
1737,1236,4,Matthew Yothers ,"And bobbymgsk, when are you going to send the previous episodes (G1: Cobb vs Meyhuber, and G2: Phillips vs Noble)?"
1738,1236,5,Matthew Yothers ,"And also, I found out that Keyonté and Chaté from the Cobb family only managed to get 143 points in Fast Money for $715."
1739,1236,6,Matthew Yothers ,That’s what happened in Fast Money on yesterday’s game 1 episode.
1740,1237,1,jpgenius ,"For no reason, the Friday second-run episodes aren’t airing in my area. But poor Nobles. 😔"
1741,1238,1,jpgenius ,GO ARRIKA! 👏🏾
1742,1239,1,jpgenius ,"Welcome back, Fishers! They seem like fun."
1743,1240,1,jpgenius ,Great job in FM by the winning teams! And I haven’t seen a family from Fort Myers (or Southwest Florida) on the Feud before.
1744,1241,1,jpgenius ,Chile… what kind of bartender… 😬
1745,1242,1,jpgenius ,"The Owens had quite the close call in FM (but it all worked out for them), and the Stephens had quite the memorable intro."
1746,1242,2,Matthew Yothers ,"Now, what’s the #1 answer for “I really don’t like going to _____”?"
1747,1243,1,jpgenius ,"Welcome back, Davises! And the first episode had my sides splitting. 😂😂😂"
1748,1244,1,jpgenius ,"I can’t believe the Scotts from “Love & Marriage: Huntsville” (that’s a reality show) are on “Family Feud!” Too bad they didn’t win, but great comeback by Seth and gameplay by Kymm! 👏🏾"
1749,1244,2,Nick Brundidge ,If she said heart she would’ve gotten all the number one answers. But I have to admit that is a very big score
1750,1245,1,Matthew Yothers ,"Great job Owens family, and good luck on getting that car tomorrow."
1751,1245,2,Matthew Yothers ,"I hope they win it, it’s been a while since we’ve given that thing away."
1752,1245,3,jpgenius ,The Owens are on a roll! But I think the Turners could be invited back soon.
1753,1246,1,jpgenius ,Mixed emotions here.
1754,1247,1,jpgenius ,The Jew family are on a roll! And great FM teamwork by the Sanders! 😉
1755,1248,1,jpgenius ,I’m sad to see the Jews and Fosters go. They were fun to watch.
1756,1249,1,jpgenius ,"While I’m bummed to see the Sanders leave, the Kisers seem like fun, and the 2nd-date question had me ROLLING. 😂😂😂"
1757,1250,1,jpgenius ,"The Riccos are on a roll! And go, Kisers! 👏🏾"
1758,1251,1,jpgenius ,"Again, I’m bummed to see the champs go. And it’s OK, Carthons, we’ll get ‘em next time."
1759,1252,1,jpgenius ,"To the Wounded Warrior contestants, thank you for your service. Both teams deserve way more than $20K! 👏🏾"
1760,1253,1,jpgenius ,"Ooh, close call for the Arguelles family in Fast Money. 😬"
1761,1254,1,Nick Brundidge ,This doesn’t make sense
1762,1254,2,jpgenius ,"Y’all, the first question of each game nearly had me on the floor. 😂"
1763,1255,1,jpgenius ,"Go, O’Gormans! 👏🏾"
1764,1256,1,jpgenius ,"What a close call for Tracey in FM, but it all worked out. 😅"
1765,1257,1,jpgenius ,"Nice job, Shaddix family!"
1766,1258,1,jpgenius ,"Close call in FM for the Travers family, but it all worked out for them! I’m sad to see the Drelicks leave, though."
1767,1259,1,jpgenius ,"Great job in FM by the Crowders, and very nice comeback by the Buchholz family! (Their FM was a roller coaster.) 👏🏾"
1768,1259,2,Nick Brundidge ,If Kevin said dress up he would’ve nailed all the number one answers
1769,1260,1,jpgenius ,"Well, so much for our hopes for a car win to cap off 2022…"
1770,1263,1,Rohan Johnson ,"UGH!!! Nowadays, We can NEVER get a car game!!! What is going on?"
1771,1263,2,Matthew Yothers ,"I’m just wondering, what does C.F. stand for?"
1772,1263,3,jpgenius ,"The Crowders had a great run, but the Bruce family were just too good. As for the Logans… they seem like fun."
1773,1264,1,jpgenius ,"Welcome back, Hoggs! The champs made great comebacks. 👏🏾"
1774,1265,1,jpgenius ,It was sad to watch the Bruces and Kinders go. I loved seeing the Kinders return.
1775,1266,1,jpgenius ,The Hoggs are on a roll! 😏
1776,1267,1,Dylan Orndorff ,finally we got a car since february 2022 of last year nice playing hoggs family!!!!!

1779,1267,4,Dylan Orndorff ,"finally we got a car since february 28, 2022 of last year nicely done hoggs family!!!!!"
1780,1267,5,jpgenius ,"FINALLY! GO, HOGGS!!! 👏🏾🎊🚗"
1781,1269,1,Matthew Yothers ,"By the way, Battle of the Bulge was the number one answer for that fourth question in game 2."
1782,1270,1,Matthew Yothers ,And that second question in the first game was a tie between temperature and blood pressure for the top answer.
